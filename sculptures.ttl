He lifts his left hand, perhaps in a gesture of surprise. Ahead of him, a bearded, nude man, probably Herakles, advances with his bent left leg, profile to the right, and hunches down to aim an arrow at the centaurs ahead of him.  Three centaurs, the last of which reaches his hands over his head, probably in anguish, as he may have been hit by Herakles, run profile to the right.  These centaurs are shown in the Archaic manner, with horse bodies, rear legs, and tails, attached to the bodies of men, just below their waists (compare to the centaurs on the Maussolleion, <rs type=\"sculpture\">London (1008)</rs>, shown in the Classical manner, with human upper bodies emerging from the lower bodies of horses).

    aa:form_style_description "<P>Like the West Pediment Athena, she stands in the center of the gable, overseeing the battle that rages on either side. Unlike the West Athena, she is more of a participant. The moment or attitude depicted is a different one. The West Athena stood as if unwilling to impose herself on the evenly matched contestants. Here too the sides are balanced, but Athena intervenes. She wields her aegis like a weapon, which she has draped over her left arm. The wide-set feet suggest a step, imminent if not yet realized. They also serve to balance the outstretched left arm which, weighted with the heavy aegis, would otherwise destabilize her. A fighting Athena is not un-archaic; she appears as such in the slightly earlier Acropolis pediment and elsewhere, though such instances are normally Gigantomachies and Athena is not the central figure. The important development here, however, is the way in which the active figure with all limbs extended visually unifies the pediment, rather than dividing it into two halves. Her more militaristic stance may also be significant in understanding the political context of the East Pediment and the reason for the change of design.</P><P>If her pose and relation to the composition as a whole exhibit a stylistic development on one level, the details of drapery and body show a striking change as well. A comparison of the heads is particularly instructive, since both are so well preserved. Ridgway has noted that the features of the East Athena occupy a larger proportion of the face. The shape is also clearly different. The widest point is at the temples rather than the cheeks, hence creating a truer oval and de-emphasizing the horizontal aspect. The added metal hairpiece was shaped to emphasize the oval or vertical aspect as well (see reconstruction drawing of the head). The upper lip is now much more prominent, down-playing the so-called archaic smile still quite noticeable in the West Athena. However the hint of a smile, as well as the relatively strong projection of the cheekbones, place the head on the crest of Early Classical development rather than well within it. The fragments of drapery likewise suggest a more free-flowing, less schematic design than the drapery of the West Athena. The contrast between the two figures is indeed great, so much so that they are often cited as representing the watershed between the Late Archaic and Early Classical style. Because of the fast-breaking developments in this period, the estimated difference in actual date may sometimes be exaggerated." ;

This is one of the five relatively well-preserved figures from the East Pediment found in 1811, taken to Rome for restoration and then to Munich. Though broken in many pieces, he is largely complete. The square cutting in the left hip allowed for a wooden dowel leaded directly to the floor of the pediment. Though this floor block is no longer extant, the position of his left leg and right arm place him clearly, like the Right Dying Warrior, at the front limit of the gable. The powerful head remains affixed to the torso. The fine hairs of his long beard are carved in great detail, a mustache set off to be picked out in paint. Like the warriors E 9 and E 10 he wears a Chalcidian helmet, with hinged cheekpieces added, the right one still in place. His helmet carried a crest, added separately.

With one less figure in each side of the pediment, the pose is clear to the viewer, unclouded by any overlapping figures. Yet the champion is not only linked with his immediate opponent, but intimately connected with the figure beyond. The strong diagonals formed by their lunging bodies appear as the legs of a triangle, giving a greater cohesiveness to the composition of the pediment as a whole. The fact that the head, until recently, was assigned to the earliest pediments indicates that the stylistic development of all figures is not necessarily even, for the torso of the champion is clearly more stylistically advanced than the schematically rendered chests and abdomens of many of the West Pediment figures.

    aa:subject_description "<P>The Champion Warrior to the right of Athena faces his opponent. His feet are set extremely far apart to give the maximum amount of force to his thrust. He is winning his one-on-one battle. His right leg forms a continuous diagonal with the torso of his body and his head. The leg is straight but not rigid, the knee not locked, giving a slight curve and a high degree of naturalism to the figure. The right arm is pulled sharply back in preparation for the thrust. It echoes the diagonal of the leg and counters its curve with a slight one of its own. Most of the weight actually rested on the bent right leg, now missing but largely reconstructed from the character of the break. The figure wears a Corinthian helmet and carries a shield, but has no other body armor. Because the lower part of his right hand is broken away, his weapon  either a lance or a sword  cannot be identified. The figure is shown in as pure a profile as any in the East Pediment, yet has depth. The right arm pulls the torso around with it, bringing the left shoulder and arm fully into view. A fragment of shield attached to the left shoulder shows that, in this case, the shield and figure were carved from the same block of marble. Some details such as the shield-stay were added. Four holes in the left forearm indicate where it was attached. The inside of the shield would have been painted, causing the arm to stand out against it. The head, in Athens with a cast in Munich, was formerly attributed to the earlier set of pediments. The neck break was altered by Thorvaldsen in the 19th century, but an extant cast made prior to that restoration proves that the head belongs.</P><P>If Athena's gesture is correctly interpreted as a threat directed specifically at this warrior, the champion must be a Trojan. Since this pediment depicts the earlier Trojan war against King Laomedon, and Priam is the only one of his sons to survive the arrows of Herakles in that campaign, Ohly's identification of this figure as Priam would seem to have merit. Both his prominent position near Athena and his youth would be fitting in this context.</P><P>No part of the plinth is preserved for this figure, although the horizontal geison blocks for this area have survived. However, in addition to the evidence provided by his pose and height, a drawing made by the Cockerell party in 1811 recorded the relative find spots in front of the East Pediment of the five principal figures. E2 is one of those recorded and his position thus confirmed. The drawing is reproduced by Ohly.</P>" ;

He has been seriously wounded in the chest, which is unprotected. His body armor consists only of greaves, in addition to his shield, weapon  probably a sword  and presumably a sword case. He has apparently lost his helmet. (See the following figure E4.) The discovery of the left foot fragment with plinth was critical for the precise placement of the figure in the pediment, although a drawing by the Cockerell expedition who discovered the sculptures in 1811 correctly restored its relative position and pose based simply on the find spot in front of the East Pediment. Until recently the figure was restored as standing but with a strong backward tilt. Ohly has now shown conclusively that the torso is in fact nearly vertical, as if the warrior is resisting the backward fall which will inevitably follow. Life is ebbing quickly from the figure, but the effects are depicted in subtle ways. The knees have begun to buckle. The left fingers have let go of the grip. The shield-stay has slipped almost to the wrist. The weight of the shield is pulling the body left and back, and consequently toward the viewer. Although the head is lost and the neck recut by Thorvaldsen, a pre-restoration cast of the torso exists. Ohly restores the head slumping toward the left shoulder.</P>" ;

    aa:date_description "<P>The destruction of the early 6th century temple, followed almost immediately by the building of the Late Archaic temple, took place about 500 B.C. The date (see below for refinements) is based on pottery associated with the burned debris and fill connected with the subsequent rebuilding. General corroboration of the date is provided by the style of the sculpture which decorated the new temple. The situation is complicated, however, because there are four sets of pedimental sculpture associated with the new temple. The latest sets, East 2 and West 2, are identified by their findspots below the pediments, where they fell when the temple collapsed in Late Antiquity. The other two sets are represented by only a few fragments, principally heads but also other pieces. Since their scale and style, especially close to West Pediment 2, leave no doubt that they were originally designed for the pediments of this temple, they must represent earlier versions of the sculptural program. Final publication of these early pediments is still pending, but the latest reports (especially Williams 1987) suggest the following scenario.</P><P>When the building of the Late Archaic temple commenced, a team of sculptors concentrated on the early East Pediment, possibly a depiction of the Rape of Aegina. This was completed and installed. Work on the early West Pediment, a battle scene with Amazons (?), was also begun. Before it was completed, however, a decision was made to change the subject matter of the pediments. The new West Pediment was apparently undertaken first, possibly because work on the west facade was already in progress. After West 2 had been completed, the east end of the building may have been temporarily closed off, since a door was cut in the opisthodomos wall to allow entry from the rear (West), while the front was being reworked. Later the rear opening was closed off with a grate, and again the East would have become the principal entrance. Finally, figures from the two early groups were exhibited in stoa-like structures on either side of the Altar Court in front of the temple.</P><P>In his publications of the 1970s, Ohly dated the destruction and rebuilding, including the change of design and carving of West Pediment 2, to the decade 510-500 B.C. Perceiving a significantly advanced style of carving in East Pediment 2, he allowed for a substantial passage of time and dated it 485-480 B.C. A number of scholars, relying on Ohly, emphasized the difference in style between the two later pediments and supported the lengthy interval in date. In recent years, however, the various scholars most closely involved with the analysis of the Aegina material have modified the dating, and now envisage a narrower time frame for work on the Late Archaic temple. New studies of the pottery (M. Moore and D. Williams) suggest, with some leeway, that both the destruction and rebuilding may have taken place as late as the first decade of the 5th century, particularly the early 490s. Following Ohly's notion that political motivation lay behind the design change, Williams suggests that both the funds and the impetus to undertake such major renovations may have come from Aegina's raids on Phaleron, possibly while the Athenian fleet was in the eastern Mediterranean ca. 498 B.C. Work on West Pediment 2 would have followed soon after. Thus, the latest studies argue for a slight lowering of the dates of these phases. Williams reports that, in notes made before his death, Ohly also was moving in this direction. The dating of East Pediment 2 is somewhat more difficult and necessarily controversial, since it depends almost wholly on considerations of style. Arguments concerning the interpretation of the iconography and the evidence of Pindar (see Stewart) have been introduced, but these are not conclusive. Ohly's attribution to the second East Pediment of fragments previously associated with the earlier pediments suggests that he had come to believe the styles of the earlier and later pediments are not so distinct as once thought. His dates in the most recent Glyptothek Guide (<bibl>Ohly 1981</bibl>), ca. 500 B.C. (West 2) and 495-490 B.C. (East 2) respectively, show that he inclined toward closing the gap. According to Williams, Martha Ohly-Dumm has identified the work of certain hands in all four of the pedimental groups. This suggests a single crew of sculptors or, at the least, strong continuity between the crews and hence less likelihood of a long interval separating the two later pediments.</P>" ;

    aa:subject_description "<P>Athena (E1) stands in the center of the pediment as warriors fight on either side. In view of the absence of Giants and Amazons and the presence of Athena, the subject appears to be a Trojanomachy, a battle of the Greeks against the Trojans. It is not, however, the famous Trojan War described in detail by Homer and depicted in the West Pediment, but rather an earlier campaign mentioned by Apollodorus (<bibl n=\"Apollod. 2.5.9\">Apollod. 2.5.9</bibl>, <bibl n=\"Apollod. 2.6.4\">Apollod. 2.6.4</bibl>) and others in which the ancestral heroes of the Aeginetans played a particularly prominent role. The key to this identification is provided by Herakles (E5) who, with his lion-headed helmet, is the one instantly identifiable figure. In one of his earlier exploits, Herakles came to Troy and saved the daughter of King Laomedon. When the king reneged on his promise to give his daughter in marriage, Herakles vowed revenge. That event provides the motive for this early battle in which Herakles returns with his friend Telamon, son of the first king Aiakos of Aegina, to seek revenge. On the basis of the literary descriptions of the episode Dieter Ohly, the principal scholar of the Aphaia pediments, has attempted to identify some of the other figures. His suggestions of identifications are repeated here. (For an alternative interpretation of the pediment, see Sinn.)</P><P>The two figures closest to Athena and hence occupying a position of special prominence should be important leaders of their respective sides, hence Telamon for the Greeks and probably one of the sons of Laomedon for the Trojans. Ohly interpreted the outstretched, aegis-covered arm of Athena as a threat directed specifically toward the figure on the right (E2), hence a Trojan. Since this warrior appears to be defeating his opponent, Ohly identifies him as Priam, the only son to survive the battle, and the next Trojan king. The figure on the left (E7) would then be Telamon. The fourth figure to whom Ohly gives a name is the dying warrior in the left corner (E11). He is singled out as Herakles' victim, so probably Laomedon himself. His mature age and regal bearing support this identification.</P><P>Unlike the West Pediment where the warriors are arranged in fighting pairs, in the East all figures converge toward the center, as if each half of the pediment represented one force. Only the leader of each force has reached the other side and met the opponent. It would be dangerous to read the pediments too literally, but perhaps it is not too far-reaching to assume that the Right Opponent and his Helper (E3 and E4) expose their backs to Herakles because he is their compatriot, one of the archers backing up the forward line. Thus the figures facing left (i.e. on the right side of the pediment) are Greeks, while those facing right are Trojans.</P><P>The importance of the theme of the pediment is indicated by the history of the Late Archaic temple which it adorns. (See also the discussion under Dating Notes.) It is now clear that this group of figures (known as East Pediment 2) was substituted for an earlier group (East Pediment 1), itself only recently finished. Since there was no evidence of physical destruction to explain the replacement, Ohly reasoned that the change was politically motivated. The subject of the earlier pediment was perhaps the Rape of Aegina by Zeus (the original location of the earlier pediments, whether east or west, is not clear), essentially a foundation myth without obvious overtones. An extra set of horizontal geison blocks with cuttings for attachment of sculpture as well as an extra central acroterion indicate that the original sculptural decoration of the east facade was fully installed before a decision was taken to replace it. The new pediment which invoked the legend of the ancestral Aeginetan heroes, who were called to fight against powerful Troy and proved themselves valiant warriors, had clear militaristic overtones. The newly designed Athena was equally militaristic in tone. Given the immense effort and expense involved in producing a new pediment, the new theme must have been considered of the highest importance and probably reflected a new initiative of the Aeginetan state." ;

    aa:form_style_description "<P>The West Athena is essentially a variation on the Late Archaic kore figure with armor. The close-set position of the feet, with the left leg turned slightly out, echoes the pose of many such figures from the last quarter of the 6th or the early 5th century. Her clothing is also typical for the period, but it is the rendering that highlights its archaic character. The fine linen of the chiton takes its usual crinkly form beneath the left arm. The material of the skirt seems much heavier. Whether this represents an additional garment is unclear. The edge of the diagonal himation is also briefly visible. Were it not for this detail, one would suspect an overfold instead, for a naturalistic layering of the folds has been pushed aside in favor of a purely schematic rendering which emphasizes the frontality of the figure. The stacked pleats below the right arm have the same aim. If the rigidity and unnaturalistic detail of Athena speak entirely of the archaic style, the head seems more advanced. Only a comparison with the head of the East Athena shows how much it too is in the archaic mode. The features still emphasize divisions within the face. The mouth is cut in sharply enough to create the ubiquitous archaic smile. The hair, though not overly elaborate in design, nonetheless shows a strong interest in pattern. The lack of a central part is also old-fashioned. The rigidity of the figure  one unbroken line extends from the paryphe through the himation folds and gorgoneion to the central crest of the helmet  suggests a statue rather than a living, breathing god. The impression of absolute stillness sets her apart from the rest of figures psychologically and compositionally.</P>" ;

He appears firmly balanced, with his weight evenly distributed. In the West Pediment the principal combatants are more evenly matched; in the East a contrast is drawn between the stronger and the weaker opponents. The shield carried on the warrior's left arm would have obscured much of the figure from the viewer. According to Ohly's scheme this warrior is a Greek. The head assigned to this figure is extremely well preserved and handsome in its detail. It represents a young, unbearded warrior with a Corinthian helmet set back on his head. The nosepiece of the helmet was made separately and has not survived. The hair is carved in great detail. The individual strands were combed from the top of head and held in place by a fillet. A single row of neat snail curls frames the face. The hair at the back of neck is equally close-cut and tidy.</P>" ;

    aa:form_style_description "<P>The figure of the Right Archer, possibly Teucer, from the West Pediment provides an instructive contrast with Herakles from the East. Both wear chiton and cuirass and are similarly posed. However, there are subtle but significant differences. The first concerns the pose. Teucer is safely balanced on three points, while Herakles rests on only two. His knee is raised just off the ground, thereby increasing the tension in the body. The difference is due partially to the interpretation of a slightly different pose, but it also represents an experiment on the part of the sculptor. Noteworthy, too, is the lack of any strut. There is a distinct difference in the modeling as well. Teucer's right thigh shows little modeling; the calf of the same leg seems a pattern of shallow indentations. Herakles' legs and especially his arms are extensively modeled. Lastly the East Pediment sculptor shows an interest in texture and natural laws not observed by the West Pediment carvers. The way in which the chiton spreads over Herakles' thigh, then forms folds which conform to the law of gravity and yet are not mere pattern shows an interest in the behavior of cloth. The skirt formed by the chiton around the back is also a contrast  one undulates while the other is stiff as leather. Most interesting, however, is not the correct rendering of an object when it must be rendered, but the decision to include details in order to illustrate an effect or add a note of authenticity. Such must be the case when the sculptor of Herakles pulled the chiton through the armhole of the cuirass and created a soft bunch of folds. Teucer exhibits no such details and appears conservative even among the West Pediment group.</P>" ;

    aa:subject_description "<P>Athena (W1) stands in the center of the pediment. On either side of her a battle rages. With the exception of the archers, one of whom is clothed in Oriental fashion (W11) while the other wears a traditional short chiton under cuirass (W4), the warriors are armed but nude. The scene appears to represent the later, famous Trojan War described in detail by Homer. This pediment focuses on the exploits of a second generation of Aeginetan heroes who fought there along with the other Greeks. The principal basis for the identification rests primarily on the Oriental archer, although the overall similarity to the East Pediment provides strong support. The prominence of Athena is unusual but, again as in the East Pediment, clearly an important element of the Aeginetan program. As part of his new reconstruction of the pediments in Munich, Dieter Ohly, whose work forms the basis of any study of this sculpture, has attempted to identify certain of the figures. His suggestions are given here.</P><P>Athena (W1) appears here in somewhat different form than in the East Pediment. As there, she is present to witness or oversee the battle. In the West Pediment, however, she stands quietly aloof and uninvolved, as if on a different plane. She makes no gesture toward the warriors and signals no individual support. Since she is present on another level, she does not divide the pediment as she does in the east. In fact, the designer has apparently treated the field of the West Pediment quite differently. The two forces appear not to belong principally to the right or left sides of the gable, but to be equally distributed throughout. The two additional warriors, for a total of twelve, make possible a traditional compositional scheme of paired opponents fighting one on one, hence three pairs on each side of Athena. The West Pediment is the earlier of the gables and clearly exhibits the older, more conservative format.</P><P>The two pairs of warriors closest to Athena are likely to represent the victorious heroes of the battle. On the Aeginetan side this should be Ajax. Figure W2, on the right of Athena, has no characteristics which permit an identification. To W9 (little remains of the figure) on the left of Athena, however, Ohly assigns a shield. It is one of two which preserve the painted device which originally must have decorated each shield. In this case the device depicts an eagle with a snake. As Ohly notes, Pindar (<bibl n=\"Pind. I. 6.51\">Pind. I. 6.51</bibl>) describes the eagle as the sign sent to announce the birth of Ajax, and the origin of his name (here derived from <foreign lang=Greek>AI)ETO/S</foreign>). Given the direct and contemporary connection of Pindar with Aegina and his evident knowledge of the pediments, the evidence is significant. The shield of his opponent W10 has also survived with paint intact. In this case the device is the forepart of a boar, but not enough is known to connect the image with a hero. If W9 and W10 represent Ajax and his Trojan opponent, W2 and W3 should represent a Trojan and Greek respectively, but specific identifications are not made.</P><P>On either side of the Champion warrior pairs are the archers. W11, on the left, wears the long-sleeved, long-legged dress with leather cuirass and hat of an Easterner, as already noted. The style of dress and role as archer together suggest the figure represents Paris. His counterpart W4 on the right should be Teucer, brother of Ajax and renowned archer in the later Trojan campaign. His short chiton and cuirass, contrasted with W11, support his Greek lineage. The archers' opponents, both victims of arrows, lie in the corners. The dying warrior W14 in the left corner is thus Greek; the figure W7 with an arrow in his chest is Trojan. The archers and their victims frame, in each case, a last pair of Greek and Trojan opponents (W5/W6 and W12/W13). More specific identifications are not offered. In both cases the warrior nearest the center is the victor, creating an even match on the battlefield.</P><P>As on the East, the West Pediment (known as West Pediment 2) was preceded by a slightly earlier pedimental group (West Pediment 1). Unlike East Pediment 1, West Pediment 1 may not have reached completion, for no extra set of geison blocks or extra acroterion has been found. Furthermore, the style and so presumably the date of the two west pediment groups are much closer than are the groups in the east. It may be that West Pediment 1 was still under construction when a decision was made to replace the sculpture. Such fragments as do exist indicate a battle theme. It has been tentatively suggested that the subject of W.P.1 was an Amazonomachy, which would parallel the Late Archaic temple in the city of Aegina nearby. A new and fuller publication by Martha Ohly Dunn of both the earlier groups, together with West Pediment 2, is pending." ;

The subtle modulation of musculature shows even through the cloth, not because it is thin but because it is soft. Similarly the genitals of the calf flatten against the shoulder of the man.

It is not a portrait in the literal sense of the word but probably should be seen as a symbolic representation of this man. There was a tradition of such dedications in the Greek East. At the same time that the individual gains prominence in Athens, albeit in idealized form, the sculptor also takes on a new respectability. On the basis of a peculiar treatment of the toes, the Moschophoros has been linked with a kore signed by Phaidimos, a sculptor associated with two other bases as well. He is the first Attic sculptor to sign his work, about the time vase painters adopt this practice as well. As Stewart notes, it is perhaps significant that this takes place shortly after Solon's reforms promote the role of artisan." ;

Archermos of Chios was also represented on the Acropolis by one or possibly two dedications, known from inscribed columns, suitable for a kore. Raubitschek has tentatively associated this Kore. The marble is thought to be Chian, and Boardman thinks the shape of the crown points in the same direction. <bibl n=\"Pliny N.H.36.11-14\">Pliny N.H.36.11-14</bibl> tells us that the family of Archermos were sculptors for generations.

The mouth, though retaining the up-lifted corners of an archaic smile, is now much softer, more relaxed, less triangular in form. The more developed form of the eyes corresponds to the equally developed forms of the body. Stylistically she is more advanced than the caryatids from Delphi and is approximately contemporary with the Siphnian Treasury there. The differences can be attributed to the Attic style of which she is considered a hallmark, although the cross-currents of stylistic influence are by now so omnipresent, especially in Athens, that an eastern influence has been claimed even for her." ;

She takes her name from the heavy wool garment which she wears over her chiton (only the hem of the chiton is visible), though the precise nature of her dress has since been questioned because a peplos does not normally form sleeves as it seems to here. The simplicity of her dress is particularly noteworthy since by this time (the early 520's) the many other korai dedicated on the Acropolis invariably wear the more elaborate Ionic himation. This difference is sometimes explained as a manifestation of her Attic style or because she is the work of an older sculptor, but it has also been suggested that she should be separated from the series of maidens who were dedications to Athena. Ridgway suggests that her costume is deliberately old-fashioned and that her rigidity and four-squareness, in striking contrast to the developed plasticity and swelling contours of her body, can best be understood as an allusion to an archaic statue. Her dress has been noted as relating to that of Artemis in this period. She wore a stephane or wreath on her head and carried an attribute in her right hand which required a hole drilled through it, in addition to whatever she offered with the other." ;

Other scholars date her to the end of the century, though there is not a hint of interest in the naturalism beginning to appear in Athens. Ridgway considers her details so unusual that she speculates whether they may represent a deliberate archaism already in the early 5th century.

This sculptor is known for his use of catenary folds and many fine ridges widely spaced, as well as motifs such as the chiton slipping off the shoulder. The overall effect of the figure emerging from the background is very pictorial. This slab is on the south side, which may have been finished later than the north and west. possibly not until the last decade of the 5th century.

The use of an equestrian pose, a subject popularized by Alexander the Great, the scale of the statue and the gilding, heretofore used for statues of divinities, point to a person of great importance. Demetrios Poliorcetes has been suggested. At least one gilded equestrian statue of his is known to have been erected in the Agora, near the statue of Demokratia, perhaps not far from the well near the Crossroads Enclosure where the pieces were discarded about 200 B.C. In the late 4th century Demetrios was considered a hero in Athens for having restored the democracy.

It shall not be permitted for anyone of the Councilors of the Council from the Areopagus  if the Demos or the democracy in Athens has been overthrown  to go up into the Areopagus or sit in the Council or deliberate about anything. If anyone  the Demos or the democracy in Athens overthrown  of the Councilors of the Areopagus goes up into the Areopagus or sits in the Council or deliberates about anything, both he and his progeny shall be deprived of civil rights and his substance shall be confiscated and a tenth given to the Goddess. The secretary of the Council shall inscribe this law on two stelai of stone and set one of them by the entrance into the Areopagus, that entrance, namely, near where one goes into the Bouleuterion, and the other in the Ekklesia.

This is the first use of an Apollo with kithara as an Apollo Patroos type. The costume has been called both feminine and Ionic and is linked to his role as musician.

    aa:subject_description "Slightly oversize female head in early Parthenon style. The posture is erect, emphasizing the long neck. The hair is held neatly in place by a wide band wrapped round the head, its ends tucked under and allowed to hang down behind the ears. This Roman head is known in three other copies, notably the Hertz head in Rome. The uniformity of detail suggests an exact copy of an important classical work. For many years it was thought to reproduce the Nike of Paionios dedicated at Olympia about 421 B.C., despite the difference between the copies and what remains of the original head. Confusion regarding the chronology of Paionios added to the problem. Harrison has shown that in fact the head is significantly earlier in style and almost certainly copies the Nike who stood on the right hand of the Athena Parthenos. The statue by Pheidias was dedicated in the Parthenon in 438 B.C. A slight asymmetry of the mouth suggests the head turned to the proper left, i.e. toward Athena, rather than down and to the right as does the Nike of Paionios. The headband correctly reflects the Pheidian original. In other respects, however, the head is indeed very close to the later Nike of Paionios, a fact which Harrison suggests is no accident. Hlscher has shown that the Nike at Olympia, dedicated by the Messenians and Naupaktians (Athenian allies) in honor of the victory at Sphacteria in 425, represented a kind of rebuke of the Spartans. The striking monument was set on a high pedestal in front of the Temple of Zeus, in a sense upstaging the Spartan victory shield set atop that temple after the battle at Tanagra some thirty years earlier. Though the dramatic composition of the Nike was a creation wholly his own, the sculptor Paionios apparently quoted the head of the famous Nike on the Acropolis, a subtle reference to the Athenians' Victory." ;

She is clearly identified by the narrow, folded aegis draped diagonally across her chest. Between the breasts, on the aegis, is a small head of Medusa. Snakes were once added in bronze, although on the back they too were of marble. The right arm extended outward, probably to hold a spear. The left was close to the body, possibly resting on a shield.</P><P>The torso was found in a Byzantine wall about 18 m. south of the Temple of Ares. Since Pausanias saw a statue of Athena there, which he attributed to a Parian sculptor named Locros, this torso is often associated (<bibl n=\"Paus. 1.8.4\">Paus. 1.8.4</bibl>). Even if correct, the relationship between the torso and temple is a loose one. The temple was moved to the Agora only in Roman times, and the number of statues Pausanias saw there suggests that it functioned as a museum as much as a cult place. It seems to have served as a collecting point for High Classical works. If the statue of Ares seen by Pausanias was the original of the Ares Borghese, as is widely believed, it is approximately contemporary with this Athena (cf. <rs type=\"sculpture\">Louvre Ma 866</rs>). The large Agora Aphrodite (<rs type=\"sculpture\">Athens, Agora S 1882</rs>) also found nearby dates from the same period. Its findspot makes it a likely candidate for one of the two Aphrodite statues noted by Pausanias.</P><P>The problem of the original placement and function of the Athena remains unanswered. Scale and stance might suggest a cult statue, but that is not certain. A Roman copy of this statue which functioned as a cult image has been found in the Temple of Allath in Palmyra. It may well be a copy in all respects, not one tempered by the influence of the Athena Parthenos as first suggested.</P>" ;

The latter identification has been made most recently by Clinton, following Ludwig Stephani.  Clinton bases his identification on the following points: (1) the boy, although shorter than the two goddesses, is shown on the same scale, and therefore shares the same status as a \"deity\" (39); (2) sandals would be inappropriate for an initiate (Schwarz 193); (3) at this time a standing, nude, Triptolemos, without his chariot, is unattested.  Another strong argument against the identification of the boy as Triptolemos, is that no traces of bronze attachments are visible for the attachment of grain stalks (Mtzger 114), although there are traces of bronze attachment elsewhere on the relief (e.g., the hole for the wreath at front of forehead of the boy, which Kore is putting on his head).  Clinton reasserts (55) that the boy is firmly grasping a grain bundle, now lost, that may have been glued on to the marble.  According to his argument that this figure is rather Ploutos, he suggests that Demeter is not giving something (grain) to the boy, but is perhaps receiving something from him, as would be appropriate with Ploutos (39-40).  The Ploutos identification is a tempting alternative to Triptolemos, especially as the boy is dressed as Ploutos usually is, with drapery over his shoulder; in the absence of the primary attribute, the keras, however, it is difficult to be sure." ;

The beard is long and finely combed; the mustache and the hair immediately beneath the lower lip even finer. The beard comes to an abrupt end, where there is a large trapezoidal cutting for attachment to another object. Blmel has determined that the head sat on a table, as the horned head illustrated in a votive relief from Megara (<rs type=\"sculpture\">Berlin 679</rs>). That this head/mask also had the ears and horns of a bull is clear from the dowel holes on the left and right of the forehead; the lead attachments for the right side are still in place.

She stands with both feet flat on a kind of plinth, which itself rests on the ground. The cover of the box sits on the ground in front of her. The right foot is placed in front of the left; the right knee projects just slightly. Otherwise the folds of her beltless peplos drop in uninterrupted vertical lines from her shoulders to her ankles. The peplos is the only garment she wears. It is folded over to the level of the hips, and was pinned on the shoulder with a bronze fibula. Open on the right side, its selvages exhibit the hint of a flutter, a treatment which is used frequently on Parthenon drapery. The garment is loosely draped around the neck, exposing the uppermost part of the chest. No necklace is visible, though it could have been painted, like the straps of the sandals and the dress itself. Traces of a pattern around the hem were still visible in Furtwngler's day. Although the body is turned ever so slightly toward the viewer, especially visible in the upper torso and emphasized by the opening of the peplos toward the back of the figure, the head is depicted in profile. The eye is slanted in line with the downward turn of the face. The eyeball is somewhat rounded, the upper and lower lids thick, the lips full. The fine strands of the hair are combed over the crown and gathered at the back of the head, where the hair is looped and held in place by a fillet wound round the head several times. The hair over the forehead is styled in soft curls. The ear was once decorated with a metal earring. While supporting the open box in her left hand, the girl holds something from it in her right hand, apparently an object which she can dangle from her thumb and index finger. It was probably painted in the space above the box. Perhaps a grave gift, perhaps a piece of jewelry, Blmel points out that the object and general motif might well have a religious significance.</P><P>The stele has a relatively elaborate crown molding as well as a molding at the base. Rather than being simply flat, the edges of the stele have been left to project in a kind of frame. Atop the stele is an elaborate floral finial consisting of two acanthus volutes and a large palmette.</P>" ;

In 1962 Travlos located the retaining wall of the temple peribolos through excavation, and found in it fill datable to the third quarter of the fifth century, but no later. In 1978 Picn studied the frieze and concluded that its style was close to that of the Nike temple, and should be dated in the 420s (<bibl>Picn 1978</bibl>; cf. <rs type=\"building\">Athens, Temple of Athena Nike</rs>, <rs type=\"sculpture\">Athens, Acropolis 973</rs>). In 1980 Miles published her reassessment of the architecture, placing the building in the mid-430's, i.e. shortly before the temple of Athena Nike.

The joining fragment (C 1) and another complete slab (E) are in Vienna (<rs type=\"sculpture\">Vienna 1093 and 1094</rs>). A fifth complete slab (in two fragments) and the non-joining fragment of a sixth are in Athens (<rs type=\"sculpture\">Athens, NM 3941</rs> and <rs type=\"sculpture\">Athens, NM 1780</rs>).</P><P>Slabs B and C may well have abutted one another; in any case, the scenes on these slabs are clearly related even though the subject has not been identified. A series of men sit or stand in quiet poses. From the left, beginning with B, a bearded man in a himation faces forward, both hands in front of his chest. On the right, two men are seated on a rocky outcropping with two summits. The center figure wears his himation over his left shoulder, seems to be bearded and sits with his left hand raised to his mouth. The figure on the right is perhaps younger, unbearded, wears his himation around his hips and sits with both hands in his lap. Below each of them is an object or objects. On the right the tied sack and bundle are clear enough. On the left the object has been called a pilos and a bucket, but perhaps it is also a sack. Other similar objects appear on the small fragment in Athens, so that it must belong to the same series of slabs. The next figure, on the left side of C1 (in Vienna, no photo in Perseus but see photo of entire slab including cast in Blmel), sits facing slightly left. His rocky seat may be part of the same outcrop depicted on B. He also is bearded, rests his right hand in his lap and extends his left arm outward, from which hangs his himation. The center figure (C2) reaches up with his right arm (only shoulder extant) and leans slightly right. The figure on the far right (C2) leans heavily on a staff, legs crossed, himation draped very loosely around his hips. He appears to look right, which suggests the continuation of the scene in that direction. The figures are relatively isolated and appear to have little to do with one another. The significance of the objects is not clear.</P><P>Slab D appears to treat another subject entirely, though it relates to the complete slabs in Vienna and Athens. The subject involves abductions of women. On the left, a man in a chlamys carries off a woman. He holds her around the waist; with her right hand, she holds her himation. A second woman, drapery flying out behind her, flees left. This takes place on level but rocky terrain. On the right a man chases the woman. He is close enough to have grabbed her himation with his outstretched arm. The is a gap in the ground cover, however, and he appears to leap over a crevasse. On the far right stands a child, a young girl, watching the action. On the slab in Vienna, a figure clutches a pillar, apparently seeking sanctuary. Another carries a child.</P><P>Various subjects have been proposed: e.g., Theseus and Peirithoos as the travelers who carry sacks. But no solution has been proven. The identity of the deity to whom the temple was dedicated is also unknown, thus providing no clue. It does appear likely from the division of the extant slabs that more than one subject was represented. It is reasonable to suppose that the subjects were divided among the four sides of the building, as in the case of the Temple of Athena Nike, its near twin." ;

The greater emphasis on the vertical portion of the folds, the variation in their widths and the symmetrical stacking of their edges from the center out are also indications of a more advanced stage of development than is typical of many of the Branchidae statues from Didyma, perhaps a quarter century earlier. The modeling of the folds of the kolpos coincides with this stage of development as well. On the other hand, the exaggerated attenuation of the hands and feet, the four-squareness of the figure and the way in which the himation fully covers the chest (rather than passing beneath the left arm) suggests that the statue was carved sometime during the third quarter of the century rather than much later." ;

In this statue the stack is indicated only by the thickness of the fabric and not by the individual representation of the ends of folds between the feet, as is sometimes the case. The chiton rests high on the ankles and forms a single deep dip between the protruding feet. The feet themselves are supported on a rounded footrest. Over the chiton the woman wears a short himation, buttoned over the right arm. This garment is distinguished by closely grouped collections of folds which begin at the buttons and fan out in a left to right direction (i.e. from the proper right shoulder across the full width of the chest), then fall vertically from the breasts. On the left arm it forms a kind of overlapping sleeve. The epiblema, which was draped over the separately-carved (and now missing) head, falls in a lappet-like arrangement over the front of the shoulders in what was apparently a Milesian fashion, before continuing down the back.</P><P>The high-backed chair, massive in form, is nonetheless distinguished by its various elements. The arms are clearly rounded and end in bosses at the front, the softness of the cushion is shown by a more subtle rounding, and the seat and legs are indicated, at least on the sides. On the front, very roughly scratched, are the letters <foreign lang=Greek>*A*R*T*E</foreign>. Since the statue was found in the vicinity of inscriptions to Artemis Lochia and Artemis Pythia as well as near a stele concerning the priestess of Artemis, Wiegand postulated a sanctuary of Artemis in the area. The statue conforms in every detail, or rather the lack of any distinguishing detail, to a series of such seated females dedicated at various locations in Ionia. Were it not for the inscription, there would be no particular reason to connect her with Artemis. Two very similar figures, found in the same excavation, are now in Istanbul (<bibl>Mendel, nos. 248-249</bibl>)." ;

The figure in the long garment closes the composition on the left in the same manner; his left shoulder is almost lost from view, though he stands somewhat in front of the central figure. His pose, with the leg supporting his weight entirely masked by the long vertical folds of his garment while the other leg is strongly turned out, is often seen in reliefs from the late 5th century. The pose is paralleled in the girl or servant figure on the Hegeso Stele (<rs type=\"sculpture\">Athens, NM 3624</rs>), whose drapery also exhibits many of the same traits as that on the Sosias Relief. It is characterized by relatively few, sharply cut folds with wide open spaces in between. It tends to hug the body in a revealing manner, forming long looping folds and vertical oblong patterns, especially over the legs. The same patterns are exhibited on the Choiseul Relief firmly dated to the year 410/09 (<rs type=\"sculpture\">Louvre Ma 831</rs>), though the style of this drapery is somewhat richer.

    aa:form_style_description "The style is unsophisticated in many respects, including the general lack of modeling, the awkward rendering of perspective and the inconsistency of proportion and scale. Superficially the relief bears some similarity to the Sikyonian metopes at Delphi, particularly the Cattle metope. In both reliefs, depth is indicated by a succession of stepped planes. In the Chrysapha relief, however, there is virtually no modulation within each plane and the transition from plane to plane is an abrupt cut-back. Thus, while some sense of depth is achieved, the effect is far less persuasive than in the metope. A second point of similarity is the combined use of frontal and profile views. Like the cattle in the same metope, the head of the nearer figure is shown in a fully frontal position while his body, and the figure behind him, is represented in profile. In apparent confusion, the upper torso is represented in a combination of those views which makes no sense at all. The impression is that these are sculptural tricks seen elsewhere and copied without a thorough understanding of what lay behind them. Although the Sikyonian metopes are usually dated in the second quarter of the 6th century, this relief can be later. Blmel puts it in the third quarter of the century and sees, in the diagonal folds of the garments among other things, Ionian influence." ;

On his feet are sandals. He holds a kantharos in front. The figure of the woman is largely obscured. Her dress is distinguished only by the folds which cover her legs. She wears a type of shoe popular in Ionia. Only the hair surrounding her forehead is treated sculpturally; the crown of the head was probably detailed in paint. In her right hand is a pomegranate. The throne is an elaborate piece of furniture: the legs resemble those of a lion, the tall back ends in a palmette and the arm is supported by a small column. A large snake, associated with death, rears up behind the throne. Standing on the footrest, facing the seated couple, are two figures miniature in scale by comparison with the two just described. Whether two women (Robertson) or a man and a woman (Blmel), they bear offerings of a cock, a blossom and eggs(?) clearly intended for the couple whom they honor.</P><P>The seated figures represent the heroized dead, honored by their relatives. That they do not represent deities was confirmed by the discovery of a similar relief inscribed with the name of Chilon, an historical figure from Sparta. On unmarked reliefs like the one from Chrysapha (a village outside Sparta), the names were probably inscribed in paint. The reliefs were erected over heroa or graves." ;

If she is Selene, then her companion might be Helios, the sun god; if Artemis, she would probably accompany her brother, Apollo.

That it belongs to a caryatid is clear from the kalathos, carved in one piece with the head, upon which rested a capital. The front of the kalathos is decorated with figures in relief. Though they are badly eroded, one can still make out Apollo playing a lyre in the center, facing right. From both sides a procession of figures approach: from the left, four women, and from the right, three women and Hermes playing the syrinx.</P><P>The face of the caryatid is oval. The eyes, inset and now missing, are slanted, with the outer corners higher. The cheeks are pronounced, the impression emphasized by the degree to which the sculptor has carved into the head in the area around the mouth. The lobe of each ear is carved with a large disk, an earring into which a metal element was once inserted. The hair is elaborately arranged. Around the face two rows of deep waves are pierced with holes for the addition of separately carved curls. The front section of hair is set off from the back, held in place by a stephane pierced with holes for the attachment of ornaments. At the back the hair descends from the crown of the head in a series of flat tresses, crimped into wavelike form.</P>" ;

    aa:subject_description "<P>The Daochos Monument stood in the northeast corner of the terrace of the Temple of Apollo. It was a long, rectangular base, on which stood nine statues. On the front face of the base, beneath each of the statues except the one on the far right, was an epigram naming the person represented and listing, in most cases, his personal achievements. From these inscriptions we learn that the dedicator of the monument was a man named Daochos from Pharsalos, who was the delegate from Thessaly to the Amphictyonic Council. From other sources we know that his term ran from 337/6 to 333/2 BC. Presumably he erected this monument during his tenure at Delphi. From the inscriptions we also learn the location and relationship of the figures represented. Daochos II (so as to distinguish him from his grandfather of the same name, also represented) stood in the position second from the left end of the base. Next to him, on the end, was his son (Sisyphos II). On his other side, in generational order, were his father (Sisyphos I), grandfather (Daochos I), great-grandfather (Agias) and great-great-grandfather (Aknonios). In addition, two other family members of his great-grandfather's generation were represented, both athletes who had won crowns in the Pythian Games (Telemachos and Agelaos). Thus six generations in the direct family line (stretching back into the late 6th century), as well as two collateral ancestors whose achievements were directly tied to the sanctuary at Delphi, were represented.</P><P>All eight of the statues of the family members are at least partially preserved, six of them substantially so. Since the plinths of two of the statues were found still in the base and two others can be placed with certainty, the remaining four statues can be identified with a fair degree of accuracy by correlating the cuttings with the poses and other factors. The large cutting at the right end must have been for a statue of Apollo, to whom the monument was dedicated. The size and shallowness of the cutting suggest that the statue was seated. Themelis proposed that a seated statue of Apollo kitharodos, found at Delphi and restored from many fragments, be associated with this base. However, the association is not certain.</P><P>Soon after the first publication of the inscriptions in 1897, Preuner realized the epigram of Agias was nearly identical with a slightly longer inscription on a statue base at Pharsalos. At the bottom of the Pharsalos inscription was the name of Lysippos, presumably the sculptor of the statue which had stood on the base. Once the statue of Agias at Delphi was reunited with its base and its Lysippean qualities noted, it became apparent that the statue at Delphi probably was a copy of the one set up in Pharsalos. The original statue, like most of the works of Lysippos, was probably cast in bronze. It must have predated the statue in Delphi, although possibly not by many years.</P><P>After the initial discovery, the question of the originality of the other statues arose. Are any of them also copies of statues by Lysippos? Are they also copies of statues which stood in Pharsalos? There is no direct evidence for connecting any of the other statues with dedications in Pharsalos or with Lysippos. Analysis suggests a mixed bag of stylistic influence at work, and it is almost certain that the statues at Delphi were carved by more than one sculptor. However, it has been noticed that the statues of Agias, Telemachos and Agelaos appear to form a group within the group (see <bibl>Adam 1966, 97ff.</bibl>). They are naked, athletes, somewhat similar in style, set in adjacent positions on the base and include the only family members who are not in the direct line of descent. They are also works which could well have been conceived in bronze and easily cast, in contrast with some of the draped statues. Thus it has been hypothesized that prototypes of these three at least may have stood at Pharsalos and served as a core of the group when Daochos decided to commission a monument at Delphi to honor his ancestors and Apollo. In fact, however, the relationship between the Delphi dedication and any sculptures at Pharsalos remains unclear.</P>" ;

The lankiness of the figure, as well as the smaller scale (in comparison with the other figures in the group, except for the equally small Sisyphos II), can perhaps be explained by the young age of the subject. The epigram suggests that Agelaos was younger than Agias and Telemachos, though they were of the same generation. Against this lankiness the head does not appear as small as it does in the statue of Agias. Nonetheless the proportions of the figure are exceedingly long and lean, much more in character with the 4th century than with the stockier figures of Polykleitos. There is no direct evidence to link the statue of Agelaos with Lysippos.

    aa:subject_description "<P>Agelaos stands to the left of Telemachos, nude as befits his identity as an athlete. He stands with his weight firmly on his right leg. Only the knee and calf of that leg are preserved, but the stance is clear from the thrust of the right hip and the relaxed position of the left leg, which is much better preserved. Although the lowest part of the left leg, ankle and foot are missing, it is certain that only the toes and ball of the foot rested on the ground. Thus the pose is quite different from that of Agias. Above the hips, the torso is much more vertical. This is especially apparent in the line of the spine. (For a back view, see <bibl>Dohrn 1968, pl. 21</bibl>.)</P><P>The original position of the arms has generated controversy. Both are lost, and although a portion of the shoulder muscle is visible, the pose has been debated. Some scholars would restore both arms raised, possibly tying a crown on his head like Polykleitos' Diadoumenos. It has been suggested that the reference to crowns in the epigram is an allusion to the pose. Others would restore at least one arm down. The head and neck are completely preserved, albeit in a battered state. The head is tilted to the proper right, in the direction of the supporting leg. The facial features are similar to those of Agias: a low forehead marked with a furrow, deeply set eyes, small ears close to the head and a small, slightly open mouth. The expression is serious; the gaze unfocused. The hair is cropped in short, curly locks. The line of a fillet arond the head is visible.</P>" ;

    aa:subject_description "<P>Agias stands nude, shown as an athletic victor. He had won prizes in all the major games, as the epigram below his statue attests. His sport was the pankration, i.e. boxing and wrestling. Here he faces forward, both feet planted firmly on the ground. Although his right leg is straight and his left leg slightly bent, the distinction between weight-bearing and free is not pronounced. He appears to shift back and forth between the two with a kind of restlessness, rather than standing at ease. His arms also are not relaxed, but are held slightly away from the body. His right hip is thrust out slightly in response to the full extension of that leg, but the overall impression is one of verticality. The torso, arms, legs and neck are powerfully built, but the body does not appear heavy. Rather a lean, relatively tall figure is suggested, the impression aided by the smallness and erectness of the head. This is how Pliny (NH 34.61ff.) describes the figures of Lysippos, who developed this canon in order to achieve precisely this effect. The head is turned slightly toward the proper left. The small eyes sunk deep into the head, large nose and firmly set mouth give the impression of an individual personality, yet the gaze into space removes the figure from this world in some sense. The back of the head is set off by a fillet, beyond which the curly, closely cropped hair springs out with a life of its own.</P><P>Agias was the great grandfather of Daochos II, who dedicated the monument at Delphi. The victories of Agias were probably won in the decade prior to 480 BC. The style of this statue places it squarely in the 4th century. Thus while the image is a portrait, it is clearly an idealized one, made long after Agias had died. A statue base found in Pharsalos, the hometown of Agias and his great grandson Daochos, carries an inscription in part nearly identical to the Agias epigram at Delphi. It appears that the Delphi inscription was excerpted from that at Pharsalos. At the end of the Pharsalos inscription is the name of Lysippos. Since the Delphi Agias embodies so many characteristics of the Lysippian style, it seems probable that it, like the inscription, copies an original set up in Pharsalos. The original statue is likely to have been in bronze. The monument in Delphi was erected between the years 337/6 and 333/2. The Pharsalos statue must be earlier, though perhaps only by a few years. In all probability it too was commissioned by Daochos, who had close ties with Alexander, an important patron of Lysippos.</P><P>For a fuller explication of the monument at Delphi and its relation to the base at Pharsalos (now lost), see the entry: <rs type=\"sculpture\">Delphi, Daochos Monument</rs>. For the text of the Pharsalos base (ed. of Preuner), as well as the most recent publication of the Delphi epigrams and a review of the chronology of the family of Daochos, see <bibl>FdDelph 3.4, no. 460 (Pouilloux, 1976)</bibl>.</P>" ;

The position is certain from the nearly complete plinth, which fits neatly into the cutting. The inscription on the front of the base gives only his name, patronymic and title. He faces forward, his weight on his right leg, his left leg slightly bent at the knee. Although the arms are not preserved, it is clear that the upper left arm extended in a nearly horizontal position from the shoulder, probably bent to hold a lance. The right arm hung down, though the forearm was clear of the body. He wears an unbelted, knee-length tunic and a short cloak of about the same length, the chlamys, which covers most of the tunic. The cloak was fastened with a metal pin on the right shoulder; the holes for the pin's insertion are preserved. On his feet are sandals, under which are socks. These are better seen on Sisyphos I, since the lower legs of Aknonios are restored.</P><P>The cloth of both garments is similarly treated. It has the same finish and appears to be of the same heavy weigh. The garments are differentiated by the way in which they are draped and by deep undercutting, especially along the lower edge of the chlamys. Both garments are characterized by relatively few folds. The broad spaces separating the vertical folds of the tunic are made interesting by light modeling. The V-shape of the lower edge of the chlamys is echoed by smaller V-shaped folds extending from the shoulders. A cowl formed by the cloth around the shoulders shields the join of the neck, which was set into the torso. The base of the neck is extant, though the head broke off and is missing.</P><P>Adam discusses this statue in some detail from a technical perspective.

The position is known from the inscription on the base. All that remains of the statue is the plinth, which fits neatly into the cutting, the sandaled left foot preserved to the ankle, the stump of a marble support behind the left foot and the sole of the right sandal with traces of the toes. The figure stood with his weight on his left leg. The right leg was flexed, since only the ball and toes of the right foot touched the ground.

Dohrn would rather restore him nude, on the basis of the narrow marble support behind the left foot, which is most similar to the support of the nude Agelaos. He believes that a heroic nude representation would be appropriate to Daochos and conjectures about a possible relationship between this statue and Lysippos' statue of Alexander with a lance. However, the draped statues also have marble supports; that of Daochos I features a simple strut behind the left leg. Furthermore the brothers Agias, Agelaos and Telemachos are nude because they are portrayed as athletes; their epigrams celebrate their athletic prowess. The younger Sisyphos' nudity is probably due to his youthful status; the lack of any accomplishments under his name suggests he is young. However, he carries a mantle over his arm, as his father did not (such a concentration of weight would have required a side support). The inscription pertaining to Daochos, which he himself must have approved, cites political accomplishments. He is a tetratch of Thessaly and its hieromnemon (representative) to the Amphictyonic Council, a statesman like his distant ancestor Aknonios, who stands fully attired at the right end of the base.

The plinth is extant, so that the position on the base as well as the pose, weight on the right leg with left leg bent and foot slightly back, is assured. The figure is set at an angle to the front of the base. His right arm, which was carved separately and attached at the shoulder, extends outward toward the viewer. He is usually restored as holding a lance. He leans slightly to his left, resting his left arm on the stump of a tree. The upper part of the stump is almost entirely covered by the mantle which he carries over his left forearm. The part of the forearm which extended beyond the mantle, including the hand, was carved separately and doweled.</P><P>The epigram of Sisyphos describes him as a military man, which explains his costume. His tunic, gathered at the waist by a belt knotted in the front, is hemmed just above the knees. At the shoulders the fabric forms short cap sleeves. An additional band is slung from the right shoulder and passes under the left arm. The garment is cut very loosely, creating an abundance of folds, especially where the cloth is cinched by the belt and the sling. Despite the heavy appearance of the drapery, which generally envelops and masks the body, the underlying forms of the chest, stomach and genitals are made to show through. On the feet are sandals laced over socks, whose upper edge is indicated by the raised surface. The head, which with the neck was carved separately and set into a hollow between the shoulders, was doweled at two points. The noticeable hole at the front was probably covered with a plug. Traces of painted pattern remain on the tunic: spirals on the sleeves and belt and a different design under the right arm.</P><P>Adam notes that this statue would have been difficult to cast, and therefore one can hypothesize that it is a work conceived in marble  designed for the monument at Delphi?  rather than a copy of a bronze statue. She has also determined, on technical grounds, that the statues of Sisyphos I and Aknonios (the two works of the group which she examines closely) were carved by different sculptors.</P>" ;

The figure depends on the herm for balance rather than for primary support. The position of the left leg, which is not preserved, is unclear. It would, however, have been slightly bent at the knee. The right arm hung loosely at the side. The head is turned slightly to the proper left, in the direction of the relaxed leg. The face has been lost; the ears and the short curls which cover his head are preserved. A mantle, fastened with a round pin, falls from the left shoulder, covering the outside of the left arm and much of the herm head and part of the shaft. The left half of the archaistic herm head, with long hair and beard and rows of snail curls around the face, as well as the herm genitalia are fully carved.</P><P>The figure represents Sisyphos II, the son of Daochos II, the dedicator of the monument. He is identified by the inscription on the face of the base, which gives only his name and patronym. He is presumably too young to have any accomplishments to list. Though the feet and plinth are missing, the statue can be restored to this position on the base from the size and shape of the cutting for the plinth, which allow for the herm support and the position of the right leg. The youthful appearance and slightly smaller scale are also appropriate to the son of the dedicator, the youngest of the six generations represented. He stands at the far right side of the monument (the generations are represented in order).</P><P>Sisyphos was presumably alive at the time of the dedication, so that the statue could hypothetically be a portrait. However, the face probably represented the same kind of idealized portrait that the statue of the long-dead Agias portrays. It is unclear whether this statue is a copy of an original set up in Pharsalos, or whether it is a copy of a statue in bronze. The inclusion of the support does not provide conclusive evidence regarding the original. This is the earliest known example of a free-standing representation of a mortal leaning on a herm, though contemporary examples, from the second half of the 4th century, are known in funerary sculpture (see <bibl>Dohrn 1968, 41</bibl>).</P>" ;

Their story is told be Herodotus (<bibl n=\"Hdt. 1.31\">Hdt. 1.31</bibl>), as it was related to Croesos by Solon, who named them as the second most blessed of men. They harnessed themselves to a wagon in place of oxen and pulled their mother 45 stades to the temple of Hera for a festival. Having accomplished this feat, they feasted, went to sleep in the temple and, at the urging of their mother, were granted the highest honor men may receive  death. Herodotus then tells us the Argives made and set up images of them in Delphi because of their excellence. An inscription on the base of Statue A, stating it was made by the sculptor [Poly]medes of Argos, suggests that these were the statues Herodotus saw. A fragmentary inscription on the other base may label that statue as Biton. The inscriptions have been much discussed and a number of readings argued, including a recent attempt to see many new letters which have not been confirmed by other scholars. Vatin has revived the suggestion that the kouroi represent the Dioskouroi.</P><P>The kouroi are naked except for boots, which distinguish them from images of Apollo and may mark them as travellers. They are stockily built, short though over-life-size, with broad shoulders and broad faces.. The heads are sub-Daedalic, i.e. triangular in form. The round eyes are set within curving upper and lower lids, the entire eye unit cut deeply into the head beneath heavy brows. The mouth is full. The large ears are set far back at the side of the head; the lobe is a flat disk. The transition between the front and sides of the head is very abrupt. A single row of large disk-like curls line the forehead. The rest of the hair, emphasizing the flat top of the head, is combed and then subdivided into large bead-like elements. In back the hair springs out from beneath the double cord which holds it in place, at the top of the ears and, again, at the base of the neck. Each of the tendrils, front and back, is neatly finished with a tie.</P><P>The abdomen is defined linearly. Another line sets off the triangular are of pubic hair above the genitals. The round knees are set off by incision as well as by modeling. The arms are held close to the body, the clenched hands securely attached to the thighs, the thumbs facing outward." ;

    aa:subject_description "<P>Included among the numerous architectural fragments built into the foundations of the later Sikyonian Treasury (<rs type=\"building\">Delphi, Treasury of the Sikyonians (III)</rs>) are the remains of a rectangular monopteros, to which the archaic sculptures belonged. This open-sided, roofed structure was supported by fourteen small columns (four by five), which carried a Doric frieze. Triglyphs were placed only over the columns, resulting in metopes of unusual width (proportion of width to height about 3:2). Of the original fourteen metopes, substantial portions of five as well as smaller fragments of others were found scattered around the foundations of the later treasury. They were sculpted in high relief and painted; detail was added with contrasting color and sometimes incision.</P><P>The metopes were decorated with mythological scenes. Identification of the figures was aided by painted inscriptions in the field. The five well-preserved metopes include:</P><P>1) A boar, presumably the Kalydonian. The large, powerful body, shown in profile, takes up the entire metope (broken on the right). Its size is emphasized by comparison with the small dog beneath its torso. Its ferocious nature is indicated by the bristling hair along its spine. It charges to the right. Hunters and perhaps the rest of a pack of dogs (a fragment of a second dog exists) must have occupied an adjacent metope. A probable inscription and traces of black paint on the bristles and the pupil of the eye were noted at the time of excavation.</P><P>2) A woman on a bull, presumably Europa on Zeus. The bull is shown in profile, moving right. It occupies the full width of the metope (broken on the right; head of bull missing) but is not out of scale with respect to the woman. The treatment is generally similar to that of the boar, though the distinctive features of each animal are represented. The fleshiness of the bull's neck is indicated by narrow, parallel folds which are modeled over the sagging skin of the throat and chest. The woman rides with both legs on the right side of the bull. She clutches his neck with her left hand and his rump with her right. Her dress is smoothly rendered with minimal modeling; detail is provided by the stripes of incised and painted pattern. A second, folded garment draped over her arm is decorated with similarly patterned stripes.</P><P>Idas following Kastor and Polydeukes (names inscribed) with cattle, the booty of a raid (broken at the left; presumably the figure of Lynkeus, brother of Idas, was shown here). The three extant figures are represented in nearly identical scale, dress and pose, despite the difference in their status and roles (Idas and Lynkeus were mortals, and in most accounts at odds with the Dioskouroi). Each wears a belt, boots and a cloak pinned over the right shoulder. The three appear to be driving the herd, which is shown three deep. The cattle are depicted in profile, except that those in the most forward plane turn their heads ninety degrees to a fully frontal position. The turned heads and the representation of the legs in parallel, successive planes combine to give an impression of extraordinary depth. The impression is increased by the position of the figures in front of the cattle. Again the legs are shown in profile, but the torsos and heads (faces destroyed) are represented in three-quarter view.</P><P>4) The ship Argo with two musicians, including Orpheus (inscribed) on the right, and the Dioskouroi on horseback on either side (Polydeukes inscribed, on the left). (Several fragments preserve the left and right sides of the metope; the missing section in the middle probably included one other figure in the boat. The right side has been trimmed to fit behind the triglyph.) The left fragment includes the prow of the ship, which is shown in profile. At the right edge of the metope the ship is cut abruptly in mid-section. Another fragment, which does not belong to this slab, demonstrates that the ship continued on another metope. The French suggest that it may have continued onto a third, thus raising the possibility that one side of the building was illustrated by a single subject (the short ends of the structure carried three metopes; however, the position of the various metopes within the frieze is not known). All figures are shown frontally, the lyre players who stand in the boat as well as the Dioskouroi on horseback outside it. One interpretation has the boat on shore, with the Dioskouroi on land. A second interpretation has the boat afloat, with the Dioskouroi represented as apparitions in their role as protectors of ships at sea. Note the treatment of the horse's mane like human hair, long beaded tresses which fall to either side of the neck.</P><P>A sheep with a woman, possibly Helle on the Golden Ram. The upper right quarter of the metope preserves a woolly sheep, with the arm of a woman (well preserved only at the wrist, which is adorned with a bracelet) holding onto its neck. The upper part of her body must lean far forward, thus in a posture close to that of Europa on the bull. The head of the sheep is broken away. A woman riding a sheep recalls the story of Helle and Phrixos, children of Athamas, who were saved from being sacrificed (ordered by a false report of the Delphic oracle) by a Golden Ram, who carried them away.</P><P>Two theories are current regarding the identity of the monopteros. One, which holds that the structure was a Sikyonian dedication, is based on the type of stone, the style and technique of the metopes and, to some extent, on the subject matter. The other, which holds that it was the dedication of a West Greek city, is based on the use of carved metopes in the building, the prominence of the Dioskouroi as subjects in the decorative scheme and on certain iconographical details.</P><P>Sikyonian dedication: The architectural fragments of both early buildings (there are blocks from a second building as well as from the monopteros) reused in the foundations of the Sikyonian Treasury are cut from the same soft limestone, which is said to match stone from a quarry near Sikyon. This lends support to the idea that, at least in the archaic period, material from dismantled dedications within the sanctuary remained the property of the original dedicator, available for reuse by them if desired. If Pausanias's identification of the Late Archaic treasury as Sikyonian is correct, the earlier buildings would be as well (<bibl n=\"Paus. 10.11.1\">Paus. 10.11.1</bibl>). The style of the reliefs, which is both painterly in certain respects and experimental in terms of sculptural relief, would also fit with Sikyon. The advanced use of perspective, particularly in the Cattle metope, the addition of elaborate pattern with a combination of incision and paint, and the palette of purple, reds, oranges and black is reminiscent of the painting of the northeast Peloponnese. The Sikyonians were known for their painting and also receptive to developments in sculpture. When the early sculptors Skyllis and Dipoinos, students of the mythical artist Daedalos, moved to Sikyon from Crete, it was already an established center of the arts (<bibl n=\"Pliny, NH 36.9\">Pliny, NH 36.9</bibl>; he gives their date (birth?) as the 50th Olympiad, i.e. 580-577; cf. <bibl>Stewart Sculpture, T15</bibl>). The coalescence of all this activity at Sikyon is not coincidental but directly related to the reign of the tyrant Kleisthenes, ca. 600-565. Because the style of the metopes point to a date in the second quarter of the 6th century, the monopteros has been thought his dedication. He was interested in Delphi (one of the principal participants in the First Sacred War), presided over Sikyon during a period of flourishing artistic activity and is known to have instituted an anti-Argive policy which directly affected such activity. Although Herodotus (<bibl n=\"Hdt. 5.67\">Hdt. 5.67</bibl>) recounts only the effect on musical activity, the subject matter of the metopes, lacking episodes from the Homeric and Theban cycles, may reflect the same policy. (A posthumous dedication, or one by his successor, may fit better with the style of the sculpture. Since it appears that Kleisthenes' successor continued his policies, this would not substantially alter the argument (<bibl>Griffin 1982, 57, 108ff.</bibl>).) Whether or not the subjects are specifically Sikyonian is another matter. Stewart reminds us that the oars of the Argo and the lance with which the Kalydonian boar was killed were both preserved at Sikyon, and there is a distant connection with Europa. Although the Dioskouroi were not the primary deities of Sikyon, they were worshipped there.</P><P>West Greek dedication: According to this theory, any connection between the monopteros and the later Sikyonian Treasury cannot be proven. Ridgway argues that the development of the use of carved metopes is linked more closely with Magna Graecia than with the Peloponnese or with Delphi itself, and that therefore the monopteros was more likely commissioned by a West Greek city. She stresses, however, that the commissioner and the builder of a monument need not be the same. De la Genire and Szeliga have independently taken up this line of argument, attributing greater importance to the prominence of the Dioskouroi in the reliefs. De la Genire argues that the building was a dedication of the West Greek city of Lokroi Epizephyroi, where the cult of the Dioskouroi was especially celebrated following the battle of the Sagra. Szeliga focuses attention on the Argo metope(s), where he thinks the Dioskouroi are represented as protectors of ships and sailors. Though he emphasizes the East Greek origin of this cult, he believes the frequent appearance of the Dioskouroi in West Greek architectural decoration and the importance of their cult in the West Greek colonies point to this region, perhaps Sicily in particular, as the source of the Delphic monopteros. He further suggests that this aspect of the Dioskouroi is directly related to Apollo as protector of the colonies, for whom the dedication was ultimately intended." ;

    aa:subject_description "<P>The East (i.e. rear) Pediment of the Siphnian Treasury depicts a local Delphic legend: the struggle between Herakles and Apollo for the oracular tripod. According to Apollodoros (<bibl n=\"Apollod. 2.6.2\">Apollod. 2.6.2</bibl>), Herakles consulted the oracle in order to rid himself of a disease. The affliction was brought on by his murder of Iphitos, done in a fit of madness. When the priestess refused to provide Herakles with a response, he started to make off with the tripod. Apollo appeared, they struggled and Zeus intervened. Other sources relate the episode with slight variations, especially with respect to the presence of other divinities in support of Apollo or Herakles. Zeus is not always mentioned, though he is a central figure in the Siphnian Pediment.</P><P>The central portion of the pedimental composition is well preserved, largely because the lower part of the figures were carved in one piece with a projecting \"bench\" along the tympanum wall. The upper wall stepped back so that the upper part of the figures could be carved in the round. In the center is Zeus, recognized as such by Ridgway who noticed the tip of a beard on his shoulder. In older accounts the figure is identified as Athena. He intervenes physically between the two adversaries. Apollo, on the left, clutches the feet of the tripod as Herakles, on the right, strides away with it over his shoulders. Both wear short chitons, as Apollo also does on the North Frieze. On the left of Apollo a goddess of approximately the same scale, probably Artemis, backs him up. Behind her, two figures of smaller scale face outward, toward the chariot, whose team of horses is partially preserved. The chariot itself is wholly missing and was probably made of metal. The kneeling attendant is well preserved, and beyond him are slight remains of a reclining figure in the corner.</P><P>On the right of Herakles, there was no supporting figure like that of Artemis. Rather, a pair in smaller scale, like those on the left, face outward. In front of them, i.e. in a plane closer to the front of the pediment, are a pair of rearing horses, and moving right, a striding male. These last three have been tentatively identified as Athena, Iolaos and Hermes, respectively, all of whom are mentioned in one or another of the literary accounts. The hole on the shoulder of the female figure may have been for the attachment of an aegis. However, the smaller scale in comparison with that of Artemis, her placement behind the horses and her pose with back to Herakles all appear to distance her from the hero and to link her more closely with the figures on the right. To what degree the figures left and right of Artemis and Herakles are directly related to the struggle over the tripod is unclear.</P>" ;

    aa:form_style_description "The friezes on the north and east sides of the Siphnian Treasury share a remarkably similar style, distinctive from that on the south and west sides. It is characterized by the close juxtaposition of many figures, boldly modeled and carved in many degrees of depth. The sense of three-dimensionality is enhanced by the frequent use of foreshortening, particularly of objects such as shields and chariot wheels but also sometimes of the figures themselves. The constant overlapping of bodies, especially on the north side, adds to a sense of the scene extending back into space, as on an actual battlefield. The compositional structure of the east is different. The shorter overall space is divided into two scenes, each of which is more intimate in nature than the battle on the north. Yet the depiction of the chariot teams in three-quarter view, for example, has much the same effect of breaking through the back plane. The three-quarter quadriga is conventional in vase painting by this date, although not in sculpture. Other elements, often noted, also link this master to the artistic medium of painting: the addition of many details in paint as well as in metal, the technique of identifying the figures with labels, the act of \"signing\" the work itself. There is ample justification for assuming this artist was a painter as well as a sculptor. His name is not known, though the surviving portion of the inscription on the north frieze that claims responsibility for the north and east sides is welcome corroboation of the evidence provided by the style. The artist is known as Master B, since his was the lesser commission in a sense, i.e. the back of the building and one of the sides. He may have been less senior than Master A. In any case, his style can reasonably be called more \"advanced\" in that it incorporates the latest artistic developments and pioneers them in architectural relief. Many of these developments took place in Athens and it is often suggested that he may have worked there, though he need not have been from there himself." ;

    aa:subject_description "<P>The East frieze is divided into two scenes. On the left a Council of the Gods depicts two groups of seated divinities facing each other. On the far left is Ares; enough of the painted inscription beside him remains to make his identity certain. In front of him sit two females. The first is usually identified as Aphrodite on the basis of a very fragmentary inscription. Brinkmann, in his restudy of the painted names, believes the inscription is retrograde and restores it as Aos, the Dorian form of Eos. The next goddess is probably Artemis, seated just behind a youthful god, almost certainly Apollo. In front of him, one of the central figures set somewhat apart, is probably Zeus. The inscriptions naming these last three are lost, though under the right foot of Zeus, on the plinth, is an inscription which appears to name Achilles. It must refer to a figure lost in the gap which occurs here. Only the fingertips of the figure to the right of Zeus remain; they touch his knee. It has been suggested that they belong to Thetis, who pleads for the life of her son Achilles. However, neither the gender of this figure nor the number of figures (one or two) which occupied the lacuna in this long block is certain. To the right of the gap are Athena and Hera, both clearly identified, and a third goddess whose name has not survived.</P><P>The scene on the right, occupying slightly more than half the length of the East frieze, shows a battle centered around the corpse of a warrior. Several inscriptions are preserved clearly enough, among them Aeneas (second from left) and Nestor (far right), to ascertain that the fight involves Greeks and Trojans. The corpse is most frequently interpreted as that of Sarpedon and the warriors as Aeneas and Hektor (name lost) versus Menelaos and Patroklos (name lost). However, Brinkmann has noted that not enough of the third letter of the <foreign lang=Greek>*M*E</foreign>... inscription remains to restore \"Menelaos\" with any certitude and he revives the suggestion of \"Memnon\". The central figures would then be the Ethiopian king Memnon (ally of Troy) and Achilles fighting over the body of Antilochos son of Nestor, as recounted in the epic Aithiopis. The companion of Achilles might then be Ajax and the charioteers Lykon (rather than Glaukon) and Automedon, respectively.</P><P>Though the subject is somewhat obscure, the argument is bolstered by the fragmentary inscription under the corpse, the presence of Nestor and particularly the inclusion of Eos and Achilles in the Council scene, if the restorations of these names are correct. It is likely that the two scenes on the East frieze are related. The presence of Eos within the context of such a select group of gods makes more sense if she is there in her capacity as mother of one of the central figures, in this case Memnon. Her pendant on the right would then be Thetis, mother of Achilles. This restoration would place the mothers of the protagonists in positions of equal advantage in watching over their sons, whose fate hangs in the balance  literally  according to Brinkmann's reconstruction. To the right of Zeus he restores Hermes holding a scale (metal attachment), weighing the souls of Memnon and Achilles. To the right of Hermes, he restores Poseidon to balance Zeus. For a full development of this argument, information on the fragmentary epic, a review of other hypotheses and a reconstruction of the lacuna in the Council scene, see <bibl>Brinkmann 1985</bibl>, 110ff. and fig. 85.

    aa:form_style_description "<P>The friezes on the north and east sides of the Siphnian Treasury share a remarkably similar style, distinctive from that on the south and west sides. It is characterized by the close juxtaposition of many figures, boldly modeled and carved in many degrees of depth. The sense of three-dimensionality is enhanced by the frequent use of foreshortening, particularly of objects such as shields and chariot wheels but also sometimes of the figures themselves. The constant overlapping of bodies, especially on the north side, adds to a sense of the scene extending back into space, as on an actual battlefield. The compositional structure of the east is different. The shorter overall space is divided into two scenes, each of which is more intimate in nature than the battle on the north. Yet the depiction of the chariot teams in three-quarter view, for example, has much the same effect of breaking through the back plane. The three-quarter quadriga is conventional in vase painting by this date, although not in sculpture. Other elements, often noted, also link this master to the artistic medium of painting: the addition of many details in paint as well as in metal, the technique of identifying the figures with labels, the act of \"signing\" the work itself. There is ample justification for assuming this artist was a painter as well as a sculptor. His name is not known, though the surviving portion of the inscription on the north frieze that claims responsibility for the north and east sides is welcome corroboation of the evidence provided by the style. The artist is known as Master B, since his was the lesser commission in a sense, i.e. the back of the building and one of the sides. He may have been less senior than Master A. In any case, his style can reasonably be called more \"advanced\" in that it incorporates the latest artistic developments and pioneers them in architectural relief. Many of these developments took place in Athens and it is often suggested that he may have worked there, though he need not have been from there himself.</P>" ;

    aa:subject_description "<P>On the long, north side of the building facing the Sacred Way, the frieze depicts a single subject: a battle between the gods and the giants. It was a subject familiar to artists of the archaic period, especially to vase painters, though previously it had not been treated in such monumental form. The sculptor, whose name has been lost to us but who was proud enough of his work to sign the relief (on the shield of one of Apollo's opponents), took advantage of the large space to convey a sense of the complexity of the battleground. Gods and giants, often fighting in pairs or triads, are interwoven left and right, up front and far back. In general the gods approach from the left, the giants from the right, according to the convention often used to indicate the victors (in this case, the gods), so that it is easy enough to tell who is friend and who is foe. However, individual identity was important as well, and to this end the sculptor borrowed the vase painter's solution of inscribing names alongside each figure, sometimes in the field, sometimes on the molding below. A new study of these inscriptions (<bibl>Brinkmann 1985</bibl>) using special lighting techniques has yielded or clarified a number of inscriptions and brought into question some of the earlier readings. It is his interpretations which are generally followed here.</P><P>On the left Hephaistos, recognizable from the bellows with which he manufactures arms for the gods, is named on the vertical molding which frames this scene. Next to him two goddesses have been called Demeter and Persephone or the Moirai (in this interpretation the third Fate is restored in the lacuna at right). The fragmentary inscription above Hephaistos' head has been variously interpreted to support one or another of these hypotheses. Brinkmann now suggests that the letter tracings be restored as \"Hestia\" (retrograde) for a new identification of the goddess adjacent to Hephaistos. The second goddess, and whoever occupied the lacuna, remain unidentified.</P><P>On the long slab which follows, a pair of giants face left to confront the goddesses. Giants were also named individually; in this instance some tracings remain although not enough to permit a restoration. Further to the right Dionysos, wearing a panther skin over a short chiton, strides toward an oncoming foe. A substantial portion of his name is preserved on the molding beneath his feet. Alongside him a goddess, once assumed to be Cybele on the basis of her lion-drawn chariot, has been identified by Brinkmann as Themis. Her name is also written on the molding below her feet (for the alternative \"Thyia\" see <bibl>Simon 1984</bibl>; in any case the <foreign lang=Greek>*Q</foreign> is assured. Ahead the lions savagely attack a giant who tries to flee.</P><P>The next confrontation involves the brother-sister pair of Apollo and Artemis; clear traces of both names survive on the molding below. He wears a short chiton and has his hair gathered at the nape of the neck. She wears a crisply pleated dress with long overfold, of fine material. Their nearest opponent, who looks back over his shoulder at them as he flees, wears a helmet whose crest is supported by a small kantharos. Much has been made of the play upon his name, which is inscribed in the field between his legs. The name of Ka[n]tharos is usually read there. Brinkmann finds no trace of the first two letters and calls him Tharos. On the ground lies the dead Ephialtes. Advancing left toward Apollo are a trio of giants: Hyperphas, Alektos and one whose name ends in ...us. It is on the shield of this last that the sculptor inscribed his name and designated the work for which he was responsible, i.e. this frieze and the one at the back (east). The stylistic and thematic unity of the north and east friezes support the claim.</P><P>The left end of the adjacent slab has not been preserved, leaving a sizable lacuna near the center of the North Frieze. It begins with the foreparts of a team of horses. Since the figure of Zeus does not appear elsewhere on the North Frieze, it is usually assumed that this is his chariot. In her careful study of the lacunae (but written before Brinkmann's study of the inscriptions), Moore (<bibl>Moore 1977</bibl>) restores Herakles, Ge and another figure, possibly Aphrodite, in this central group of divinities. Brinkmann would include Hera, since he finds no traces of the letters which are usually cited as evidence for identifying the giant-slaying goddess in front of the chariot as Hera. Whoever this goddess is, her victim [Porphy]rion lies slain on the ground.</P><P>Next, Athena single-handedly attacks two giants, one of whom is called Eriktypos. Beyond this group, the giant Astarias lies dead while Biatas and another giant attack a male figure with long hair and beard whose name is partially preserved on the molding beneath his feet. Brinkmann reads parts of four letters including a \"chi\", from which he restores \"Achilles\". The figure has also been identified as Ares. Still ahead is another group of two giants fighting a god. He is long-haired, bearded and wears a skin over his chiton. On the molding Brinkmann reads faint traces of a name which is easily restored as \"Hermes\". The last figures preserved on the broken, right end of this fragment are a god and a figure with long chiton riding in a chariot. Their names have not been preserved, but the absence of Poseidon and Amphitrite elsewhere in this scene make it likely that they are represented here. The actual end of this long slab is preserved in a small fragment which joins the corner return of the West Frieze. On it are the right leg and torso of a giant who faces the missing chariot team. Overlapping with him a single, unidentified god does battle with two giants, one of whom has been forced to his knees while the second, Mimon (his name is inscribed on the vertical molding which closes the scene, like that of Hephaistos on the east end) acts to save his companion.</P>" ;

    aa:subject_description "<P>Approximately two-thirds of the west frieze has been preserved, consisting of two long blocks, P and Q. From the short return on its left end, we know that P is a corner block occupying the left third of the frieze. The male figure in the corner is easily identifiable as Hermes, wearing winged boots and a short cloak, carrying a kerykeion (bronze tip missing) and reaching forward, probably to calm the horses. Facing him is a team of winged horses hitched to the chariot of Athena (wheel once in bronze). Though the upper portion of Athena is severely eroded, she is clearly identifiable by the snaky aegis which envelopes her. She steps into the chariot with her right foot, the remains of her left foot still on the ground. Behind her is a second male figure. He is badly damaged and, beyond his function as attendant to Athena, his identity is difficult to establish.</P><P>To the right of Block P was a small \"key\" block ca. 0.18 m in width, now missing. Its existence has been proven on architectural grounds, on the basis of marks on the top of Block Q which correspond to related points on the crowning course above. Whatever was carved upon this missing \"key\" block  a figure and a palm tree have both been postulated  served as a transition between the narrative elements of Blocks P and Q.</P><P>To the right of the \"key\" block, occupying the central third of the frieze, is Block Q. It must belong in this position since it has no corner return. It too depicts a woman, probably another goddess, with a chariot and team. Unlike Athena, she appears to be stepping out of her transport, as if she has just arrived. The action of her right hand, sometimes interpreted as fingering her necklace, has led to her identification as Aphrodite. Another suggestion, given new credence by a careful study of Greek chariots, has her grasping the reins, but this does not alter the identification of her as Aphrodite (<bibl>Moore 1985</bibl>. Several difficult-to-decipher elements on the right end of this slab may represent the fronds of a palm tree, a landscape element perhaps counter-balanced by another tree on the missing \"key\" block just discussed.</P><P>The similar compositional scheme of Slabs P and Q make it likely that the missing third slab also depicted a goddess with a chariot. If the identification of the central goddess as Aphrodite is correct, the subject is perhaps the Judgment of Paris. The third slab would then depict Hera with her team and presumably the figure of Paris. The greatest problem with this interpretation is the lack of parallels in archaic art for the inclusion of the chariots. However, such depictions of the subject are known from a later period, and the design may represent an invention of this sculptor in response to the unusual length of the field to be filled. Though it is not certain that the subject is the Judgment of Paris, no other suggestion, e.g. the Arrival of Herakles in Olympos, has been more persuasively argued.</P><P>For a proposed reconstruction of the West Frieze following a detail discussion of its various elements, see <bibl>Moore 1985</bibl>. Note in particular the symmetrical positioning of the trees over the caryatids, indicating that the sculptor/designer considered the effect of the composition not only within the frieze itself, but also as it related to the facade as a whole. Its position on the front of the building gave it particular prominence, and certainly both the subject and composition were designed with that prominence in mind.</P>" ;

    aa:date_description "<P>The Siphnian Treasury is one of the most securely dated monuments of the Archaic period. As such, it is extremely important, since the date of so much else is pinned upon it. Our evidence for the date comes primarily from Herodotus (<bibl n=\"Hdt. 3.57-58\">Hdt. 3.57-58</bibl>). He relates how the Siphnians grew prosperous from their gold and silver mines, how they dedicated the treasury at Delphi from a tithe of their profits and how, when they were building the treasury, they consulted the oracle to ask how long their prosperity would last. He also relates how Samian exiles came to prosperous Siphnos, ravaged the island and eventually extorted the sum of 100 talents. This is linked to Cambyses' attack on Egypt, which took place (according to well-dated Egyptian records) in 525 BC. The ravaging of the island and the huge sum extracted combined to bring an end to the prosperity of Siphnos, exactly as the oracle had foretold. Thus the expensive treasury must have been built by ca. 525, since after that time resources were lacking. How far back the prosperity extended and thus how long before 525 the treasury might have been built is not known, but the sense of the Greek suggests that all these events  the prosperity, the building of the treasury, the consulting of the oracle and the Samian sack  took place within a short space of time. As Robertson notes, the argument is partly circular, but the style of the sculpture accords well with a scheme which places them in the decade of the 520s.</P><P>Pausanias (<bibl n=\"Paus. 10.11.2\">Paus. 10.11.2</bibl>) provides an additional piece of information. He says that the Siphnian mines were flooded and rendered inaccessible after the islanders neglected to pay the tithe to Delphi. There is no clear linkage of this event to the events of 525, although the evidence of the two sources is sometimes conflated. The text suggests the flooding was due to divine intervention; the suggestion has been made that natural causes were responsible. Whatever the explanation or the date of the closing of the mines, there is no evidence to suggest that Siphnos regained its earlier prosperity.</P><P>In 1983 Francis and Vickers suggested a significant downdating of the Siphnian Treasury, by about fifty years (<bibl>Francis 1983</bibl>).

    aa:form_style_description "<P>Although designed and executed within a short span of time just prior to 525 BC, the sculptural decoration of the Siphnian Treasury exhibits two rather distinct styles. This is probably attributable to the division of work between two sculptors and their workshops. The hypothesis seems to be confirmed in an inscription on the north frieze, where one of the artists takes responsibility for the sculptures on the north and the east sides (for the inscription, see the entry on the North Frieze). The stylistic uniformity of these two sides bears out this claim. The carving is bold, varied in depth and makes use of conventions practiced by Attic vase painters. Partly for this reason the sculptor is often thought to have been an Athenian or someone familiar with Athenian work. The style is advanced for its time. Since the name of the artist is illegible (despite several attempts to recognize the names of known personalities), this sculptor is generally referred to as Master B. He is likely responsible for the East Pediment as well.</P><P>Master A is the name given to the sculptor responsible for the south and west (front) sides. These two sides likewise share a similar approach. Unlike the varied depth of carving on the north and east, two planes are emphasized: the foreplane of the figures and the background of the relief. Views are mostly confined to the frontal and profile; little use is made of foreshortening and there is limited sense of the figures turning in space. The style is somewhat old fashioned, especially in comparison with the north and east sides. It appears to reflect an East Greek approach. The same sculptor is probably also responsible for the caryatids on the porch. That this sculptor was the older, preeminent artist is likely in view of his assignment of the front of the building. At the time the treasury was built it faced the archaic entrance to the sanctuary. The initial views of a visitor were of the west and south sides. When the Sacred Way was extended in the early 5th century, the approach was changed to the east and the first view was of the back and north sides.</P>" ;

The agreement followed an unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the Athenian tyrant Hippias, which in turn followed the assassination of Hippias' brother Hipparchos in 514 BC. Work presumably began shortly thereafter, since Herodotus goes on to explain how the Alkmeonidai bribed the Pythian priestess to enlist Spartan support in the overthrow of Hippias. Apparently it was the intention of the Alkmeonidai to curry favor with the oracle. Herodotus also relates that they built the East facade in marble although the contract called only for poros limestone; whether this was done before or after Hippias was expelled in 510 BC, i.e. in hope of or in gratitude for the victory, is unclear. A fragment of Philochoros may provide the answer (<bibl n=\"Philoch., FGH 328 F 115\">Philoch., FGH 328 F 115</bibl>, a scholion to <bibl n=\"Pind. P. 7.9b\">Pind. P. 7.9b</bibl>; see <bibl>Stewart Sculpture, T34</bibl>). It confirms Herodotus' information that the Alkmeonidai built the temple, but says that they initially used the funds to defeat Hippias, building the temple only after their victory but with greater gratitude (<foreign lang=Greek>met' eu)xaristhri/wn pleio/nwn</foreign>), i.e. the marble of the East facade.</P><P>In any case, both authors date the temple, certainly the sculpture of the pediments (perhaps the last part of the temple to be completed), to the years around 510 BC. This date has sometimes been contested because of the stylistic similarity between the pedimental korai and Antenor's kore (<rs type=\"sculpture\">Athens,Acropolis 681</rs>), which for a long time was dated about 530 BC. It is also known that the Egyptian king Amasis gave money for the temple before his death in 526 BC (<bibl n=\"Hdt. 2.180\">Hdt. 2.180</bibl>). However, various discoveries, among them the disassociation of the Anonymous Caryatid from the Knidian Treasury, have led to a lowering of the chronology, which places Antenor's Kore around 520 BC. (It has been suggested that the dedicator Nearchos was a grandson of the famous potter Nearchos, since his known works date before the middle of the century.) This decreases the gap in time between the two commissions so that the similarity in style makes more sense. Since Antenor's other famous commission was the group of the Tyrannicides, those men responsible for Hipparchos's death, his alliance with the Alkmeonidai and connection with the temple at Delphi is all the more likely." ;

    aa:form_style_description "<P>All discussions of the style of the East Pediment sculpture of the Temple of Apollo focus on the figures of the korai and kouroi, particularly the former. They have long been recognized as being closely related to a kore from Athens (<rs type=\"sculpture\">Athens,Acropolis 681</rs>), known as Antenor's Kore from the base attributed to it which bears Antenor's name as sculptor (See <bibl>Stewart Sculpture, 4.2.4.5</bibl>). (The kore cannot be proved to belong to the base, but the connection is generally accepted.) The korai share many characteristics including the same broad shoulders and a nearly identical treatment of the drapery, ranging from the pattern of ridges and spaces of the chiton, the arrangement of the himation and particularly the tubular shape of its folds (commonly described as organ pipes) to the method of undercutting used to achieve this effect. The heads of the Delphi korai are not preserved, but the head of the Nike acroterion belonging to the temple has survived (<rs type=\"sculpture\">Delphi, Temple of Apollo, Nike</rs>) and is likewise related to Antenor's kore, in the shape of the face and features and in the treatment of the hair. The eyes of Antenor's kore were inlaid, a somewhat unusual feature, as were those of the horses on the pediment. The differences which do exist may be attributed to the architectural function of the Delphi sculpture and to the difference in the date of their execution (Antenor's kore is probably earlier). On the basis of the similarities the East Pediment, and often the entire sculptural program of the Temple of Apollo, is assigned to Antenor. The son of Eumenes, a painter, he is otherwise known from work in Athens, which accords with Herodotus' statement that the rebuilding of the temple was undertaken by the Alkmeonids, an Athenian clan. For the chronological problems, including the attribution to Antenor, see the section on the Date.</P><P>More generally speaking, the design of the pediment represents a stylistic bridge between archaic and late archaic or early classical composition. Both the inclusion of the animal groups and the strict frontality of the figures link it with earlier pediments and distinguish it from pediments of the early 5th century, including comparable\"quiet\" compositions like that of the East Pediment of the Temple of Zeus at Olympia.</P>" ;

    aa:subject_description "<P>The principal subject of the East Pediment of the later archaic Temple of Apollo (replacing the one which burned in ca. 548 BC) is the arrival of Apollo in Delphi. The chariot team of Apollo, with horses facing front (foreparts only), occupied the center of the pediment. On either side of the quadriga are a trio of figures, korai (maidens) on the left and kouroi (male figures) on the right. These also face front for the most part, the exception being the largest of the kouroi, who is shown in three-quarter view. (Only two of the korai and one kouros are substantially preserved. The other three figures, i.e. the smallest kore and the largest and smallest kouroi, are represented only by small fragments and therefore not included in the museum reconstruction, nor in photographs here. For these fragments, see <bibl>FdDelph 4.3</bibl>.) Still closer to the corners are animal groups in the tradition of early archaic pedimental sculpture, like the lion-and-bull groups from the Acropolis which have been attributed to the Hekatompedon temple in Athens. On the left are a lion and a bull; on the right a lion and a stag. The pieces which occupied the pedimental corners have not been identified.</P><P>The sculpture has been attributed to the pediment on the basis of material (Parian marble), technique (free-standing, though very rough in the back), scale and style. The East and West Pediments are easily distinguished, since the West Pediment figures are sculpted in poros and are technically in high relief. The reconstruction relies on the composition (especially of the lion groups) and restored height of the various figures for their placement within the pediment. Courby proved that the horses were grouped in a single, central quadriga facing front (<bibl>FdDelph 4.3, 40</bibl>). The French excavators have restored the korai and kouroi to the left and right, respectively, and Apollo alone in his chariot (<bibl>GuideDelphMu 1991, fig. 16 caption</bibl>).</P><P>The subject of the pediment appears to reflect the same Delphic tradition as the opening lines of Aeschylus' Eumenides (<bibl n=\"Aesch. Eum. 1-19\">Aesch. Eum. 1-19</bibl>), which may provide a clue to the identity of some of the figures. Aeschylus first describes the history of the oracular seat at Delphi, naming Ge, Themis and Phoebe as the prophets prior to Apollo (the three korai?). He then describes the arrival of Apollo from Delos via Athens, escorted by the children of Hephaistos, i.e. the Athenians, and greeted by the king and people of Delphi (the kouroi representing some combination of these?; see <bibl>Stewart 1990, 88</bibl>). This peaceful version of Apollo's arrival, one that includes the Athenians, stands in marked contrast to another version in which Apollo arrives and takes over amidst violence, usurping what had been the province of Ge. The choice of composition surely reflects the fact that the pediment was paid for by the Alkmeonidai of Athens, as we know from Herodotus (<bibl n=\"Hdt. 5.62\">Hdt. 5.62</bibl>). The lion groups do not appear to be directly related to this theme. They probably serve the same apotropaic function they once had as a central pedimental image. Thus the subject matter of the pediment is partly narrative, directly related to Apollo, and partly pure symbol.</P>" ;

The same treatment of the drapery characterizes the striding male figure. The recumbent giant finds no parallel on the East Pediment, but the torsion of the figure represents a development not seen in slightly earlier sculpture, e.g. on the North Frieze of the Siphnian Treasury, and so appears in keeping with the date proposed for the East Pediment by Antenor. This suggests that the sculpture of both pediments as well as the akroterial sculpture should be assigned to one workshop, under the direction of Antenor, and that it can all be dated to the same period, in the years around 510 BC." ;

    aa:subject_description "<P>According to Euripides' <hi rend=\"ital\">Ion</hi> (<bibl n=\"Eur. Ion 190 ff.\">Eur. Ion 190 ff.</bibl>) the subject of the West Pediment of the Temple of Apollo was the Gigantomachy. This is borne out by the few figures which survive. They include a fighting female, a nude male in prone position, a standing male wearing a robe and an animal skin, and relatively small fragments of two horses. The chorus of the <hi rend=\"ital\">Ion</hi>, describing what they see in the pediment, mention Herakles, Iolaos, a figure on a winged horse, Athena, Enkelados (her opponent), Zeus, Mimas (his foe), Dionysos and several monsters. The full reconstruction of the pediment offered by the French excavators is, as they say, only hypothetical. The attribution of the figures is secure, since they are easily distinguished from the East Pediment sculpture by their material: poros covered with stucco and paint, rather than the marble of the East Pediment.</P><P>The figure of a fighting female, moving left, wears a chiton (much of the painted decoration of the dress is still visible) and short himation. At the top of the fragment a mass of stone which appears to protrude beyond the folds of the himation is usually identified as an aegis, and thus the figure as Athena. No part of its surface remains, but the mass suggests that it covered both shoulders and extended behind her. Drilled holes have been interpreted as points of attachment for the snakes. The second substantially preserved figure must be that of a giant. His torso is represented in three-quarter view while the extended right leg is in profile. He knelt on his left knee, in pose much like the giant from the roughly contemporary Peisistratid Temple in Athens (see <rs type=\"building\">Athens,Old Temple of Athena</rs>). The third figure, preserved only partially from the waist down, is said to be a male. He is represented in three-quarter view from the back, moving left. He wears a pleated chiton of mid-calf length, and an animal skin (a paw hangs over the left-most pleat). As for the identity of the figure, both Apollo and Dionysos have been suggested. Finally, there are fragments of horses: the neck of one and the chest of the other.</P><P>The reconstruction places these figures with some certainty. It is clear that the giant belongs near the left corner. Athena's height puts her about midway back on the left side. The figure with the skin is probably close behind her. Since the carving of his right side shows that he was placed against another figure or object, he is restored as one of a pair. The horses are restored as a frontal quadriga, like that on the East Pediment. Presumably the chariot belonged to Zeus. Beyond this, the composition can only be surmised.</P><P>Despite the technical difference in the execution of the two pediments and the fact that only the marble pediment is specifically attributed to the Alkmeonidai by Herodotus, most scholars agree that both pediments should be attributed to the same designer and workshop. The inclusion of the frontal quadriga in the center of the composition, the design similarities between Athena and the Nike akroterion, similar technical features in the treatment of the drapery and the carving of the figures to create the impression of free-standing sculpture support the impression of a unified program of sculptural decoration for the entire temple.</P>" ;

Both stories gave the sculptors a rare opportunity/excuse to illustrate partly-clothed women, and thus experiment with textural contrasts (flesh v. drapery) as well as female anatomy, at a time when female nudity was uncommon in Greek art.<P>A particularly popular episode is shown on slab 6: Kaineus, who had been made invulnerable by Poseidon, is driven into the ground.

The position of the right arm, which was carved separately and is missing in its entirety, is less clear. The figure is heavily swathed in drapery, consisting of two garments. The full-length tunic  Waywell suggests it may be the Asiatic surma  is pinned on each shoulder, from which point broadly-spaced pleats descend over the chest. The voluminous himation is folded over, gathered under the left arm, passed around the body and up over the left shoulder in back, from which it drops down the left side of the figure. On the feet are laced sandals with thick soles, which are worn over a sock.</P><P>The face is that of a man of middle age, with features that convey the impression of a highly individualized portrait, and one that does not attempt to idealize the physical appearance of the man portrayed. He has a low and extremely broad brow, marked by a deep furrow which emphasizes the strong bulge over the nose and eyes. The long nose is joined to the forehead by a high, wide bridge. The eyes are set deep into the head and are widely spaced. Deep age lines separate the cheeks from the mouth. He wears a mustache and short beard. The long hair is brushed straight back from the forehead and allowed to fall down the shoulders.</P><P>Following the discovery of the figure by Newton, it was identified as Mausolus and attributed to the chariot group which was placed on the top of the tomb. The identification was based largely on the discovery of several fragments of the chariot and horses in the same area. The large female figure found close by was identified as Artemisia and also assigned to the chariot. The association with the chariot group is now usually rejected, notably by Waywell who published the free-standing sculpture of the Mausoleum. He cites the following reasons for disassociating these two figures: 1) the findspot does not provide solid evidence for the original position of the sculpture on the building, 2) the scale of the figures is too small in comparison with the horses and 3) there are a number of fragments of similarly large figures (a minimum of eleven), far too many to be associated with the chariot. He believes that all these figures belong to a series of portraits of individuals connected with the Hecatomnid dynasty (to which Mausolos belonged), and that they were placed in the intercolumniations of the Ionic peristyle high on the building. Whether or not the identification of the figure as Mausolus need also be rejected is a different, and still much debated, matter.</P>" ;

On her left it falls over the shoulder and down the left side, covering the upper arm almost entirely. On her right it covers the shoulder and is pulled under the forearm, across the front of the body in a twist and, finally, over the left forearm. The effect created is that of a triangular form over a pillar. The lower portion of the figure, the pillar, is much more austere than the upper torso with its multiplicity of folds.

Thanatos, the personification of death, shown as a nude, winged youth, wearing a scabbard that rests against his left hip, stands in a nearly frontal posture, slightly to the right, beckoning to a young woman to his right.  This woman, who is traditionally identified as Iphigenia (who was led away for sacrifice to Artemis, before she was spared by that goddess, who substituted a deer for the girl), Persephone (who spent half the year in the underworld, as the bride of Hades), or Alkestis (who volunteered to die in place of her husband, and later returned from death), is not clearly identifiable. She stands in a frontal posture, wears a sleeved chiton, around which she wraps a cloak, or himation.  Although her head and upper left arm (which is raised) are missing, she seems to be raising her himation to veil her face, a gesture known as anakalypsis, the unveiling (or veiling) of the face, which is a typical bridal gesture (anakalypsis).  This would support the identification of this woman as Persephone or Alkestis.  As Stewart points out, however, only Iphigenia is thematically related to Artemis.  To her right stands Hermes, a nude youthful god, with a chlamys (or trave;ler's cloak) over his left arm, and a kerykeion, or herald's staff, in his left hand.  These attributes emphasis his role here as psychopompos, or guide of the dead souls. Beyond Hermes is another woman, also standing frontally, but dressed in a peplos, a more matronly costume. Her head and upraised right arm are missing. To her right is a seated male figure wearing sandals and a himation draped over his legs (his upper body is entirely missing). If the female figure on the other side is to be identified as Iphigenia, then these figures are identifiable as Klytaimnestra, who was tricked into sending Iphigenia to sacrifice (at Aulis) by her husband Agamemnon, and Kalchas, the seer who ordered Agamemnon to sacrifice Iphigenia as an atonement (see <bibl n=\"Eur. IA 355\">Eur.

Her sanctuary was located in the Piraeus, where this relief was said to be found. The goddess stands at the right dressed in a short chiton-like garment with overfold reaching to the hips. The lightweight cloth produces many folds, especially where the dress is caught up by the animal skin worn from the left shoulder and wrapped tightly around the waist. It is a garment similar to one often worn by Greek Artemis. However the close-fitting long sleeves, resembling an element of Oriental costume, apparently belong to a garment worn beneath the chiton. For a similar representation see the inscribed figure of Bendis on the skyphos in Tbingen (Univ S/10 1347). The hood is also Eastern in style. Over the chiton and skin she wears a Thracian mantle fastened in front by a round brooch. Her legs are protected by long, leather boots. Her left hand is raised, capping the point of a long spear. With her right hand she appears to offer a round object to her worshippers, usually identified as a patera, though possibly the wreaths mentioned on the Copenhagen relief (see below).</P><P>To the left extends a line of worshippers led by two older, bearded and filleted (at least the second) men dressed in himatia.

Pryce notes that the full, rounded beard belongs to a late type of satyr and compares the pose to vase paintings in Pfuhl, pl. 125-6.

The satyrs are crouched in a kneeling position, in an exaggerated use of the archaic convention for running. The satyr on the left (Block 292) brandishes a tree branch as a spear. Since they are essentially mirror images, the second satyr must have carried one as well, though it is not preserved. Each satyr, animal or animal group takes up the full height and length of the slab. The composition was apparently a formal one, and at least with respect to the symmetrical imagery is non-Greek. There is an overriding interest in portraying various kinds of animals, rather than depicting any semblance of an actual hunt.

By process of elimination involving the minimum restored length of the frieze (which excludes Building H as a possible location), the French excavators have associated the frieze with Building F on the acropolis of Xanthos. Too little of this building remains to reconstruct it in any detail, though its approximate shape and dimensions have been determined on the basis of the extant foundations and by analogy with Building H. The sculpted pediment London BM 289 (<bibl>Xanthos 2, pl. 48,2</bibl>) has also been assigned to the structure. The frieze apparently ran around the building, decorating the socle. No corner blocks have survived, which Metzger attributes to the difficulty of incorporating them as part of the rebuilt frieze in the late fortification wall. In addition to the blocks removed from the acropolis wall by Fellows, one additional block was later found. It is broken on both the left and right sides but is important in that it preserves the original depth of the frieze course.</P><P>Poultry appear as a decorative motif in Greek art, most frequently in the 6th century. According to Keller, (see <bibl>Pryce 1911</bibl>), their appearance at this time is a reflection of the growth in their economic importance. Their occurrence at Xanthos is one indication of the influence of Greek iconography and style in Lycian sculpture, at least from the 5th century. The frieze had originally been dated to the 6th century, since the closest parallels occur on Greek vases of the archaic period. However, French excavators have determined that Building G, like all structures in that area of the Acropolis, was part of the general rebuilding which took place following the conflagration of ca. 470, and no other suitable foundations for a building of the proper size have been found. The frieze must therefore exemplify a lingering use of the archaic style. The strength of its archaic character along with its stylistic affinity to the Harpy Tomb, one of the few monuments (on the opposite side of the acropolis) thought to have survived the fire, have led the French to identify Building G as the first of the structures erected in the rebuilding program. Extensive archaic remains in the immediate area of Building G indicate a cult structure on the same site in the archaic period." ;

If the object was a bow, as seems likely, the figure almost surely represents Apollo. When found in the sea off Tuscany in the 19th century, the statue was thought to be an original work of the second quarter of the 5th century BC. That view is no longer generally held. The breadth of the torso is entirely out of proportion to the thin arms and legs and small head. The elaborate coiffure is also out of keeping with an early 5th century date. The inscription on the foot is not good evidence, since it may have been added later. However, it apparently is not archaic or early classical but rather, like the statue itself, archaizing.

    aa:subject_description "<P>Statue of a young Athena in peplos, usually accepted as the Athena which together with a statue of Marsyas comprised a two-figure group by the sculptor Myron. The identification of the group is based on several kinds of evidence: literary references, images of the group on coins and vases, and a number of copies which clearly derive from a single archetype, probably in bronze.</P><P>The most complete copy and the only one which preserves the head is in Frankfurt. The copy in the Louvre exhibits slight differences but is clearly based on the same original. Athena steps to the left, placing her weight on her right leg and trailing her left leg behind. She looks back over her left shoulder  at Marsyas, from whom she is stepping away. She wears a belted Doric peplos with an overfold which reaches to her hips. The portion of the drapery over the upper torso forms a large \"V\" in front which descends to the waist, with a mass of narrow folds to the side of each breast. In the center below the waist is a single, very wide fold, again emphasized by the numerous smaller folds to either side. The skirt of the peplos descends in unbroken vertical folds over the weight leg and between the legs, while the fabric is caught over the knee and calf of the free leg.</P><P>Our knowledge of the sculpture stems from Pausanias's statement (<bibl n=\"Paus. 1.24.1\">Paus. 1.24.1</bibl> that he saw a group on the Athenian Acropolis of Athena striking Marsyas as she threw away her flutes. Amelung recognized that the Frankfurt Athena type and a certain 5th century satyr type (best copy in the Lateran) conform closely to images of such a group on coins and an oinochoe in Berlin (<rs type=\"vase\">Berlin F 2418</rs>). The multiple copies in marble in addition to the representation on coins and vases make it clear that the group was very famous. Since Pliny (<bibl n=\"Pliny NH 34.57\">Pliny NH 34.57</bibl>) tells us that Myron made a Minerva (=Athena) and a satyr gazing at pipes, and the date of the sculptural prototypes (not long after the mid-5th century) is in line with his career, it is assumed that the group is by him.</P><P>The subject stems from the story of Athena's invention of the double flutes. She saw a reflection of herself while playing them one day and, disliking the image of her puffy cheeks, threw them on the ground. Marsyas saw them and moved to pick them up. Apparently Athena did not strike him literally, but with her eyes, as a warning that he was not to touch the things of the gods. This is the moment represented. He could not resist the temptation and later lost his skin for daring to challenge Apollo's musical preeminence. That image of Marsyas was also immortalized in sculpture, but at another time.</P><P>The combining of the Frankfurt Athena and Lateran Marsyas has occasionally been questioned. The fact that he, a mortal, should be as tall as the goddess has been bothersome, but in fact his head does not rise above hers. Her small scale and slight body frame are explained by her young age, appropriate in the case of such youthful vanity. A young Athena was also represented on the Olympia metopes, though perhaps not as young as she is here. A second problem according to some scholars concerns the date of the Lateran Marsyas type, i.e. whether he is not an invention of the later 5th century. However, comparison with the Parthenon sculptures suggests that he could be contemporary. The subject of Marsyas begins to appear on Athenian vases at about the same time. Melanippides also wrote a play about him. Although its date is not known, it is possible that the play provided the inspiration for the outpouring of visual images. It has also been suggested Myron's group may have been designed in honor of a victory by that play in a dramatic contest (<bibl>Boardman 1956</bibl>)." ;

The sphinx on a cavetto capital in the Kerameikos Museum (<bibl>Boardman 1978, figs. 226.1-2</bibl>) is also strikingly alike in the treatment of the eyes. The low-set ear of similar shape with tragus adjoining the cheek and a short band behind the ear which marks the beginning of the beading suggests a common stylistic source. These sphinxes are generally dated to ca. 560-50 B.C. The Lyon Kore is likewise not far removed stylistically, though its more developed forms indicate a later date.

The retention of early forms include the high ear still lacking in detailed anatomical features, lack of indication of neck muscles, a lower boundary of the abdomen defined by straight rather than curving lines leading to the genitals and flanks which are still perfectly level.

The hair over the forehead is divided by a center part and combed to either side. It frames the face with soft waves, covers the lower part of the ear and then is pulled to the back. The hair on the crown of the head is set off by a fillet, which is tied at the center back of the head. The hair was apparently gathered at the back of the neck, at a point below the break.</P><P>The severity of the head led to an initial dating in the Early Classical period (ca. 460 B.C.). The treatment of the hair, which recalls work in bronze, led to an alleged connection with the Early Classical sculptor Kalamis. Comparison with the Ludovisi Throne led to an identification of the subject as Aphrodite. All of these hypotheses have long been questioned, but they are still discussed, along with the additional possibility that the head is a copy of an Early Classical original in bronze. The Louvre catalogue (<bibl>Hamiaux 1992, 266</bibl>) states that the mediocre treatment of the back of the hair needs to be given more consideration in any analysis of the head, thus throwing into question its date, its originality or even its status as a copy, and any value it may have in discussing the style of Kalamis or of the Early Classical period." ;

The fully integrated transition from the front to the sides of the head, particularly the rounded profile of the forehead, also argues for a more advanced stage of development.

It is set off from the neck and left arm by a raised and finely finished border. Except at the border the chiton reflects the modeling of the body beneath, and neither indicates the texture of the cloth nor exhibits any interest in surface pattern on the part of the sculptor. In this respect the figure is like the Lyon Kore. Over the chiton she wears a himation draped from the right shoulder which passes under the left breast and arm. Again there is little interest in surface pattern. Folds are certainly indicated, but in simple, straight-forward fashion. The edge of the himation which passes under the left arm consists of a single clean fold. The part of the himation which covers the right breast and arm is rendered as perfectly smooth, though in this case the heavy weight of the cloth is evident by the way in which it hides, rather than exhibits, the modulations of the body which it covers. The folds form stacks in the usual way both in front and in back. They do not fall uniformly vertically, but reflect the pull of the himation toward the left arm. Below the himation, the lower part of the chiton is again completely smooth in so far as it is preserved. Only the edge of the paryphe is indicated by a raised edge. It forms a broad curve where it is grasped by the left hand at the side of the leg. The hair consists of two tendrils which fall forward over each shoulder, and nine others which fall down the back. On the back they do not form a single mass but are also carved as individual tendrils, separated by spaces near the ends. The tendrils are divided by horizontal chisel cuts into pinch-style beads.</P><P>The feet and plinth of a kore found in the same area which bear the same museum number were disassociated from the torso years ago on the basis of style and scale.

The overfold fans out smoothly over the fully bloused kolpos and hangs much lower directly below the arms. The garment forms wide vertical pleats on the proper right side, the straightness of the lines interrupted only over the right foot. Over the left leg the fabric catches at the ankle, where it forms a gentle curve over the calf. The woman holds her right hand to her face; in her left hand is a small box. The smaller woman on the left side also wears a belted peplos, with a longer overfold but without a kolpos. Her feet are shod in sandals. She held something out to the figure of the deceased. Her head, which is missing, was carved entirely in the round. They stand on a roughly worked plinth which has been cut back at either end." ;

Though for years she was the only known example of this type, her style had led scholars to assume she was a copy of a classical statue of the 4c BC. The 1959 discovery of a cache of bronzes in the Piraeus included an Athena so close in scale and detail to the Mattei that it now appears to be the archetype from which the Mattei was derived. If this assumption is correct, the Piraeus bronze provides a correct restoration of the missing fragments of the Mattei and helps to explain a few stylistic anomalies of the statue which had appeared troublesome. Waywell published a short study of the Mattei which examines the divergencies from the bronze statue and seeks to explain them.</P><P>Athena faces forward, weight on the right leg, left leg relaxed and foot slightly back, breaking the vertical fall of the drapery on the back and left sides. Her left arm is bent and held somewhat apart from the body. In the modern restoration the hand is open to the viewer, in an unexplained gesture. Waywell has shown, however, that the arm parallels that of the Piraeus Athena insofar as it is preserved and in all probability copied it fully, i.e. the hand turned inward, grasping a spear and/or a shield. The right arm, however, has been intentionally altered by the copyist. Waywell suggests that the extended position of the arm in the bronze Athena could not be reproduced in marble without the addition of an awkward support and that the hand-on-hip pose was adopted as an economical alternative. That the pose changes the essential character of the image was evidently not a factor of great importance to the copyist. The only other differences concern the more pronounced turn of the head of the Mattei, which Waywell again attributes to an incorrect restoration (the break on the right side of the neck is not clean), and the substitution of rams' heads for the owls on the cheek pieces of the helmet, an unexplained change but a rather minor detail." ;

This degree of development also corresponds with the Tenea-Volomandra Group of kouroi. Within the quarter century, the Cheramyes dedications appear to be relatively early. Stylistically they are certainly later than the earliest group of large stone Samian dedications, sometimes dated to the 7th century, but they appear to be earlier than the Geneleos dedication, usually dated a decade or so later, i.e. a little before the middle of the century. As Kyrieleis points out, an absolute chronology for the Samian series cannot be proven, nor a precise correspondence with the Attic series established, but the relative sequence can now be reasonably well understood." ;

    aa:subject_description "<P>Among the earliest of the 6th century korai from Samos. A columnar figure, over life-size, carved in one piece with the plinth. She wears three garments: a chiton of light-weight material which forms numerous fine folds and is gathered at the waist by a belt, a short himation of somewhat heavier fabric which passes over the right shoulder and both breasts then under the left arm, and a folded epiblema which is worn over the head as a veil and falls nearly to the ground. Its right edge is caught up by the right hand, while a corner of the opposite side is hooked under the belt. The right arm is carved adjacent to the body, its form largely masked by the garments which cover it. The correct anatomical positioning of the forearm is blurred for the same reason, though the knuckles of the hand are visible through the drapery and the thumb is clearly positioned over the opening of the fist. The left arm is held so that the hand is positioned between the breasts. The squared-off position of the fingers suggests the hand was treated as a fist and therefore probably held some object. At the feet, the chiton splays outward in circular fashion almost to the edge of the plinth. A small arched-shaped opening allows for the protrusion of the toes.</P><P>The inscription to Hera is carved in small, neat letters along the edge of the epiblema, running down the center of the body. The original identification of the statue as Hera, however, was based primarily on the wearing of the veil. Since her discovery so many veiled korai have been discovered that the attribute is more often considered a Samian or East Greek fashion than a mark of divine or even semi-divine status. The fact that most extant Samian korai are headless has complicated the issue. However, Ridgway points out that because some local korai without veils have been found, the attribute must carry some meaning. The significance may be limited to an indication of marital status, despite the long tradition of veiled goddesses in the Near East.</P><P>In 1983 a nearly identical kore was found in the Heraion, of the same form and dimensions and carrying the same inscription. Perhaps they were differentiated by the objects which they held. Several meters away was a base with cuttings for plinths of two statues exactly matching those of the new-found kore and the statue in the Louvre. Given the proximity of the find-spots, the appropriate dimensions of the cuttings and the fact that no other dedications of this size have been found at Samos, it is likely that these two statues originally stood in the base. The fact that two such dedications stood side by side eliminates the possibility that they were intended as representations of Hera herself. Rather, they must have represented \"servant figures\" dedicated to the worship of Hera.</P><P>The base provides other information as well. The location of the cuttings (one runs off the edge of the block) and the treatment of its sides make it clear that this is but one block of a base which continued to either side. Thus it appears to be a multi-figure dedication like the slightly later example of Geneleos, also in Samos. There are now three certain figures and a probable fourth dedicated by Cheramyes at the Heraion. In addition to the Louvre kore and the 1983 kore, there is a third in Berlin (Berlin 1750) and a fragmentary kouros whose inscription preserves the last part of the dedicator's name as <foreign lang=Greek>...*M*U*H*S</foreign>, probably the same man. Whether these two other statues stood on the long base cannot be said. However, it is surely the case that as a patron Cheramyes was responsible for an important group of dedications that stood near the head of a long tradition in Samos and that, assuming he was not the sculptor himself, employed a gifted and innovative artist whose works set new standards for the distinguished series which followed." ;

She discusses the later Actium kouros alongside the kouros from Tenea, whose proximity to Corinth (a few miles) might suggest a similar stylistic heritage for it. She also notes, however, that dedications in sanctuaries need not be local in origin. The Actium kouroi do appear to share a common stylistic basis, despite the twenty-odd years by which Richter proposes to separate them. The emphatic use of ridges and grooves to delineate certain anatomical features, particularly the clavicles, shoulder blades and abdomen, is retained in the later Actium kouros despite its naturalistic development overall. On the other hand, the soft modeling, so restrained that the pectoral muscles are barely indicated, is evident in the earlier statue as well. A more advanced state of development is shown by the appearance of certain anatomical features as the iliac crest, a softening of the previously exaggerated waist and the generally longer and slimmer proportions, especially of the torso proper.</P><P>Buschor and Wallenstein also suggest a Corinthian origin or influence.

The front is delineated by a series of ridges and grooves: horizontal clavicles, a shallow but clear median line descending from the sternum to the navel and a distinctly marked arch separating the thorax from the abdomen. Four horizontal lines divide the abdomen above the navel. In the back the spine is indicated not only by a central vertical groove, but by parallel grooves on either side. The shoulder blades are distinctively marked as well, though are less noticeable since these lines abut the hair. The overall proportions are long and slender. The shoulders slope; the arms hang loosely at the sides but have been carefully separated along the torso from the arm pit to below the wrist. The hands are clenched. On the hips a soft ridge marks the iliac crest. The left leg is well advanced. The hair is massed softly over the shoulders, then gathered loosely behind with a double band of ribbon. Below the ribbon it falls neatly in a narrow spread almost to the middle of the neck. All the hair is carefully rendered in a beaded style. A bronze statuette from Argos exhibits a similar coiffure (<bibl>AuKGP 1986, pl. 71</bibl>).</P><P>Like the kouroi from Sounion and the Ptoon Sanctuary in Boeotia, the Actium youths are closely linked with Apollo since they apparently come from his sanctuary.

However, if the sculpture exhibits a lingering rather than true archaic style, as had been thought, it is difficult to know how late in the 5th century it was carved. Daux suggested a range of 485-470 BC. Jeffery preferred a date around 465 BC for the inscriptions. Perhaps under the influence of a late dating of the inscriptions, scholars had leaned toward the low end of this range. Most recently, however, Holtzmann has argued for a date just before 480 BC, in which case the style is less out of line with sculpture elsewhere in Greece than had previously been thought. Daux pointed out that the inscriptions may have been added at a later time, despite the close relationship to the reliefs." ;

    aa:subject_description "<P>The reliefs occupied a central position in the Passage des Theories, an important and expensively constructed structure (walls of marble orthostates) at the northeast corner of the Agora. It takes its name from the list of Theoroi inscribed on the wall, but in addition to its function as a passageway it was apparently an important place of cult.</P><P>The large relief was set into the west wall. To the left of a large niche is Apollo in long chiton and mantle, holding a lyre in his left hand. He is crowned by a follower, possibly Artemis. On the right side are three females, identified as Nymphs by the inscription over the niche, variously dressed and carrying offerings. All figures approach the niche, although Apollo has halted and partially turned, presumably to permit his crowning. A clue to the cultic function of the niche is provided by another relief from the acropolis of Thasos, illustrated by Boardman and now in the Getty Museum. Inside the shrine is a statue of a female deity; if seated she is perhaps Cybele although her identification is by no means clear. Although the relief is only partially preserved, the architectural form of the niche is similar and it too is approached by female figures in profile and closely approximate in scale. An archaic votive relief with veiled female figures in a niche inscribed to the nymphs has recently been found in Miletus (Von Graeve in <bibl>AuKGP 1986, 24f</bibl>.</P><P>The east side of the Passage was treated somewhat differently, with an opening for an altar in the center of the wall. The original position of the two small reliefs is not precisely known (the exact location from which Miller removed them was not clearly recorded), but Roux has reconstructed a probable placement on the two facing walls of the niche of the actual altar. Essentially they depict a mirror composition of the two ends of the large relief. On the right side of the altar is Hermes, identified by his characteristic chlamys, cap and kerykeion, and behind him a female in pointed hat, perhaps Hekate. Hermes approaches and extends his right arm toward the actual place of sacrifice in this case, rather than an image of such. On the other relief (essentially, the left half of a single composition) the three females represent the Graces, again identified by the inscription which refers to them in the context of instructions for the cult. They approach the altar from the left.</P><P>Note that in some old publications the reliefs are referred to as the Prytaneion Reliefs, from a mistaken identification of their findspot as the Prytaneion of Thasos." ;

They do not wear jewelry. Each holds a pomegranate (or flower, according to some) in her raised right hand. The figure on the left holds some sort of pouch in her left hand, from which it dangles. The figure on the right also appears to hold another object, but since the relief is broken across her hand, the object is difficult to identify.</P><P>Since the time of its discovery in 1863, the relief has been a focus of controversy. It is now generally agreed that the relief is funerary rather than votive, that the figures represented are mortals rather than goddesses, and that both figures are standing (there may be less consensus on this score).

    aa:subject_description "Left hand portion of an unusually long slab, at the N end of the East Frieze of the Parthenon. The right hand portion is in the British Museum. The Louvre block depicts two men facing right and six women moving left, i.e. toward the center. The men are presumably officials; the women possibly the Ergastinai (weavers of the peplos) or some other participants in the cult. The man on the left (Figure 49) is dressed in a himation and sandals. His head, like most of those on the slab, is now missing but was drawn by Carrey. It was apparently unbearded. With both hands he holds a flattish object, perhaps a tablet, or tray or basket for offerings. There is some disagreement as to whether he is offering or has just received the object from the first pair of women, who stand before him with empty hands. (See <bibl>Brommer 1977, 121-3</bibl> for a summation of views.) The women generally walk in twos, weight on the left leg, right leg forward. They wear peploi made seemingly from yards of fabric, with long overfolds and richly gathered kolpoi, and shorter mantles pinned at the shoulders which fall down their backs. Like all the figures, they wear sandals. The face of Figure 51 is largely preserved and depicts a young woman. The break at the back of her head suggests her hair was gathered in back and then allowed to fall freely down her neck, as the hair of Figure 55. Hands hang loosely at their sides; they carry no attributes or offerings. Behind them stands the second official, in dress and pose close to Figure 49. His hands are empty but with the index finger of his left hand he points or motions to the other approaching women. Carrey's drawing suggests he too was unbearded. The next women, Figures 53 and 54, duplicate with minor variations in detail the pose and dress of the preceding pair. Their hands also rest at their sides, empty. In the case of both pairs the right hand of the figure in the foreground is visible, though the left hand of the figure in the rear is not. A step behind another woman walks alone. She, too, is similar in most respects although she carries a phiale in her right hand. Lastly, Figure 56 turns her head to look back. The gesture is clear despite the loss of the head from the turn of the neck, the bit of hair on its proper right side and the twist of the body corresponding to the turn of the head. Her dress also differs in the shortness of the overfold of her peplos, which just covers her breasts." ;

The face is surrounded by a mass of loose curls. In the back the hair is brushed up off the neck and held in place by a diadem, whose position is clearly indicated by the carving. Holes for the attachment of metal are located along its line, as well as on both ear lobes.</P><P>The head has long been attributed to the Parthenon pediments on the basis of style as well as scale. The attribution has been almost universally accepted, although the question of which particular figure or even which pediment is represented has not been determined. Brommer gives a summary of the bibliography and various hypotheses up to 1963 in his publication of the pediments. The most frequent suggestion gives the head to Nike, charioteer of Athena in the West Pediment. The break of the neck, however, furnishes no clear join with any of the extant figures. In her publication of a roughly contemporary head from the Athenian Agora, Harrison notes that the upper eyelid overlaps the lower in the outer corner of the left eye, though not of the right eye. This treatment, together with the more careful rendering of the left ear and the hair on the left side of the face, leads her to believe that the head was designed to be seen in a three-quarter view from the proper left side and hence would come from the right half of the pediment, whether East or West. This would eliminate the attribution to Nike, Figure West G, as a possibility. The figure of Amphitrite on the East Pediment is a possibility. Brommer, on the other hand, believes the optimal view is essentially from the front and suggests more can be determined by the fault lines of the marble. However, the much heavier weathering on the left side of the face may not reflect its original position, but rather its later history, such as the period when it was built into a Venetian wall. Similarly, the depression on the back of the head may reflect some later vicissitude rather than an original reworking of the head. In any case, the theory once advanced by Sauer that it was cut to fit under the overhanging lip of the geison is probably not the correct explanation." ;

The staff-like object in his left hand is probably a tool, perhaps a poker. The round objects have been interpreted both as ingots and as bellows (in which case the roughened surface within the rim is seen as leather). The flat objects on the ground may be part of the bellows. The representation is thus highly personal and must have been specially commissioned. The longer inscription, in elegiac verse, says that the memorial was erected by his children and honors his justice, good sense and virtue. The frame of the relief is treated as a fully developed naiskos with antae, a lintel, an eave, and antefixes. Sosinos sits in front of it.

The inscription was carved in the following year and the relief must be contemporary with it. The relief occupies the entire width of the upper portion of the stele and is bounded at the top and bottom by a simple flat molding. The lower molding serves as a ground line on which two figures and a tree stand. On the left is Athena, recognizable by her dress (a belted peplos), pose and the spear she carries. She pivots slightly on her left leg to acknowledge the bearded male figure on the other side of the tree. He wears a himation draped loosely around his body and carries a staff under his left arm. His right arm is raised in a gesture to Athena. Although his face is not well preserved, it is apparent that he is an older man. He has been called both Demos and Erechtheus. In favor of the identification as Erechtheus are his bare feet (in contrast to those of Athena), which may underline his connection with his mother Ge. A similar figure, possibly also Erechtheus, appears on the east side of the Parthenon frieze (see <bibl>Harrison 1979, 71, 79</bibl>). Perhaps of greater significance is the fact that Erechtheus shared a sanctuary with Athena, where the treasures of the Athenians were originally kept. The tree between the two figures on the relief (probably with painted leaves, now lost) must represent Athena's olive tree, which was located just outside that sanctuary. As joint guardian of the Acropolis and its treasures, Erechtheus is the most appropriate figure to be represented with Athena on the relief (<bibl>Lawton 1984</bibl>)." ;

The shoulders do not reflect this twist, however, leading Richter to assume the torso reflects an earlier stage of development than might otherwise be thought. The stylized treatment of the pubic hair might also be considered an archaic holdover.

Acquired by Duke Alfonse II d'Este, in Ferrara, in 1571.  1598 sent to Modena, and to the Habsburg King Rudolph II, in Prague (by 1604), where it remained until 1782/84, when it was sold to the sculptor, Malinisky.  It was discovered in a corner of his garden in 1791, by Dr. Barth, who acquired it for a ducat, and took it to Vienna (in 1799?).  After a restoration by J.M. Fischer, the statue was hed by Joseph Drdra, in Prague, in 1807.  Finally acquired for Munich in 1814." ;

The bearded, older man, seated on a diphros near profile to the left, wears sandals and a himation around his lower half.  He rests his feet on a footstool, holds his left hand in his lap, and raises a staff, the end of which he holds in his right hand.  His longish wavy hair was once bound by a metal taenia (thirteen attachment holes remain). The second woman stands behind him, near profile to the left. She wears a chiton and a himation bunched under her left arm, draped over her left shoulder, and over her head, which she seems to hold with her right hand, over her right shoulder. An attachment hole in her left ear indicates that she wore a metal earring. In her lowered left hand she holds the upraised hand of a young girl (shown as a diminutive adult), standing in a nearly frontal pose.  The girl, whose right leg is relaxed, wears slippers and a sleeveless chiton with an overfold. She wears her hair similarly to the adult women, and holds a toy (rattle?) in her lowered left hand." ;

Her curly hair cascades down her back. The seated woman, presumably the girl's mother, holds a bird in her right hand, to which the child reaches her right arm. To the right stand a younger woman and an older, bearded man, shaking hands.  The woman stands in 3/4-view to the right (although her head is shown in profile), with her right leg relaxed.  She also wears a chiton and himation, the end of which is draped over her bent left arm. Her long curly hair cascades down her back, but seems to be bound loosely at the back of her neck.  The bearded man seems to lean on a staff (presumably under his left arm, where his himation is tucked), and relaxes his left leg.

He stretches his (upper) right arm to the left of the stele (now missing). Behind, and somewhat beneath him lies a wounded, nude, warrior, on an uneven surface. He is shown in a supine position, with his lower torso turned toward the viewer, his chest in a 3/4-view, turned slightly toward the top of the stele, and his head in 3/4-view, turned toward the bottom of the stele. He lies on some drapery, presumably his chlamys, which is fastened with a circular brooch at the front of his chest, and holds his left arm flat on the ground, his right arm bent over the top of his head (he still clutches a sword in his right hand). Behind him is a long-haired warrior, also dressed in a belted chitoniskos and a pilos, wearing a nebris, or animal pelt, over his left arm, fastened on his right shoulder.

She holds her right hand at her side, and a box in her bent left arm, at waist level. Ahead of her stands a woman, Stratokleia, shown in 3/4-view to the right, with her weight on her left leg. She wears a himation twisted around her waist, over a chiton. Her hair is gathered in a bun at the nape of her neck, while her hair is rolled to frame her face. In front of her is Leonike (probably Aristomache's mother), seated near profile to the right on a klismos, or backed chair. She too wears a himation draped over both shoulders and swathed around a chiton. Her left hand rests on her lap, while she raises her bent right arm slightly, to shake hands with Aristomache, who stands in front of her. Behind her stands a bearded man, Aiolos (probably Aristomache's father), 3/4-view to the right, although his face is shown in profile to the right. He wears a himation over his left shoulder. He holds both arms above waist level, and reaches his left hand to touch the arm of Aristomache. Opposite him stands Aristomache, whose body is shown 3/4-view to the left, with her head near profile to the left. Her hair is arranged similarly to that of the standing woman opposite her.  She too wears a himation over a chiton, although her himation is arranged diagonally across her upper chest, and falls over her left shoulder. Behind her stands another woman, Axiomache, shown frontally. Her clothing is arranged similarly to that of the first standing woman. She tilts her head slightly toward the central figures, holds her left hand to her cheek (in a mourning gesture), and rests her left elbow in her right hand. To her left (viewer's right) stands another small girl, perhaps a servant, 3/4-view to the left.

    aa:subject_description "<P>Pausanias (<bibl n=\"Paus. 5.10.8\">Paus. 5.10.8</bibl>) identifies the subject of the East Pediment as the chariot race between Oenomaos, King of Pisa, and Pelops, a suitor of Oenomaos' daughter Hippodameia. He adds that the race has not yet begun. The quietness of the scene suggests that the specific event is the taking of the oath by the contestants before the race, watched over by Zeus (H) in the center of the pediment. According to the traditional account, Oenomaos was forewarned that he would die at the hands of his son-in-law. In order to prevent this, he challenged each suitor to a race for his daughter, believing that the horses given him by his father Ares could outrun any others. In each case the suitor was given a headstart, but before he could reach the end of the course, Oenomaos had caught up and killed him. Finally Pelops was able to thwart Oenomaos' strategy. According to one version he tricked Oenomaos by bribing his charioteer Myrtilos to replace the lynch pin of his master's chariot with one of wax, which soon weakened, sending Oenomaos to his death. In Pindar's version (<bibl n=\"Pind. O. 1.85\">Pind. O. 1.85</bibl>), contemporary with the sculptures, he won by obtaining faster horses from his lover Poseidon. There is no indication which version is alluded to in the pediment, though possibly something in the expression of Sterope (F?), wife of Oenomaos, suggests anxiety concerning her husband's impending fate. The links with Pindar apparent in the metopes make it likely that his version is also the one current here. In any case, there is certainly an allusion to the fall of Pisa to the Eleans which resulted in the building of this temple.</P><P>Pausanias eases the identification of the figures by naming all the principal ones and some of the others. Nonetheless there is much controversy regarding the restoration of the pediment. More than sixty arrangements have been proposed. Part of the problem rests with the language of Pausanias. When he speaks of Oenomaos \"on the right\" of Zeus, it is unclear whether he means the god's right or the viewer's right. While it is clear that the older of the two figures (I) must be Oenomaus and the younger (G) Pelops, it is not certain on which half of the pediment each belongs. Historically there has also been a controversy with respect to the identity of the two central female figures, i.e. which one is Sterope and which one Hippodameia. Many scholars now agree that Figure K's dress and gesture of adjusting the cloth on her shoulder allude to a bride and should therefore identify her as Hippodameia. On the other hand Figure F's hair and contemplative, perhaps anxious pose suggest the older woman Sterope. Yet a third controversy concerns the position of the women relative to the men.</P><P>Pausanias identified many of the other figures as well, although it is not certain that his identifications are correct (he visited six and a half centuries after the temple was built). He called the two kneeling figures in front of the horses (B and O) charioteers, though he did not recognize that Figure O is a girl. He named the two figures following the chariot teams as attendants (L,C,N,E), though most scholars believe that Figure N is a seer. The boy (E) has often been identified as Arkas, the eponymous hero of Arcadia. The corner figures (A and P) are usually identified as local river gods, following Pausanias, though they have also been called spectators of the race, perhaps along with the other outermost figures.</P>" ;

    aa:subject_description "<P>We know from Pausanias (<bibl n=\"Paus. 5.10.9\">Paus. 5.10.9</bibl>) the subjects of the metopes: the Twelve (canonic) Labors of Herakles which he performed for King Eurystheus of Argos during the years he spent in the king's service, as the Delphic oracle had ordered. The metopes decorated the ends of the inner building, six over the east porch and six over the west porch, each Labor occupying one panel. In literature the twelve were known as the Dodekathlos. Pausanias apparently recorded them in the order in which he viewed them, since the findspots seem to confirm his arrangement. He lists those on the East first, reading from left to right: the Erymanthian boar, the horses of Diomedes, Geryon, Atlas bringing the apples of the Hesperides, (Cerberus, which should follow here, was inadvertently omitted) and lastly, the Augean stables. Those on the West follow, this time from right to left: the Amazon, the Keryneian hind, the Cretan bull, the Stymphalian birds, the Lernaean Hydra and the Nemean Lion. However, if one begins at the West end and reads in each case from left to right  the course a visitor would have followed before entering the cella of the temple, as Robertson argues  the metopes follow a chronological logic, since the Nemean Lion was traditionally the first Labor and Cerberus the last. The Augean stables (Augeas was king of Elis) may have been added because of its local importance. It has been proposed by Brommer and others that this order represents a rearrangement after the temple was damaged by earthquake and that the original order was based on a different logic. However, the evidence of Pausanias, the findspots, a possible stylistic distinction between East and West under the present arrangement, the Greek letters <foreign lang=\"Greek\">A</foreign> and <foreign lang=\"Greek\">G</foreign> (the numerals 1 and 3) on the Augean Stables and Atlas metopes (<bibl>Robertson 1975, 274</bibl>) and the balancing presence of Athena on the first, third, tenth and twelfth metopes as the order now stands, has led most scholars to accept the arrangement presented here.</P><P>The choice of Herakles for the sculptural decoration of a temple dedicated to Zeus, especially at Olympia, is understandable. He is not only a son of Zeus and great- grandson of Pelops but the preeminent athlete and founder of the Olympic Games. The Labors were sometimes referred to as the Athloi by the ancient Greeks and, as contests, required many of the same skills as those needed by contestants in the Games. The metopes may also be read in this wider sense, with references which go beyond a simple telling of Herakles' exploits.</P><P>The erection of the Temple of Zeus with its sculptural adornment represents the first major building following the Persian invasion of Greece. It is the first significant monument of the Early Classical period and the sculpture in particular illustrates the extraordinary change which has taken place since the Archaic Period. The metopes reflect this new attitude in virtually every respect. From the choice of the moment at which each Labor is depicted  usually late in the struggle or after its completion, rather than at its height  to the choice of composition  a distillation to the minimal number of characters presented in the the most simple geometric form  the overall impression is strikingly different from the archaic representations of these episodes. The details differ in an equally substantial way. The faces are somber, the drapery heavy with simple lines; the interest, whether in human form or emotion, is focussed on the underlying or internal rather than the surface.</P>" ;

It is confirmed by Pausanias (<bibl n=\"Paus. 5.10.8\">Paus. 5.10.8</bibl>), although he seems confused about certain details. In the center the imposing figure (L) must be a god, not Peirithoos as Pausanias reports. It parallels the central figure of Zeus in the East Pediment, not only in size and position, but as a silent figure, invisible to the other participants, who exists as an observer on a different plane. He has been called Zeus, like his counterpart, though most scholars believe he represents Apollo.</P><P>On either side of the central figure is a threesome of centaur, Lapith woman and hero, whose positions are a matter of controversy. The heroes must represent Theseus and Peirithoos, rather than Kaineos (again, Pausanias seems confused). Theseus is generally identified as Figure M, since he carries the axe mentioned by Pausanias. A nearly identical image appears on a krater in New York by the Painter of the Woolly Satyrs, including the garment fallen around the legs, while a similar representation exists on a <rs type=\"vase\">Niobid Painter krater in Berlin</rs>. Both vases may reflect monumental painting, particularly a Centauromachy in the Theseion in Athens. The other hero (K) must then be Peirithoos. One of the Centaur/woman groups must represent Eurytion and Deidameia, the wife of Peirithoos. Figs. H and I are commonly assigned this designation and placed next to Fig. K. However, the fine linen dress of Figure O may suggest that she is the bride, and she may be paired with Theseus rather than with her husband. Lastly, the usual arrangement places the figures of the heroes next to the god. An alternative restoration reverses this order, setting the women and centaurs next to the central figure, where Pausanias located Eurytion and Deidameia.</P><P>The figures which fill out the remainder of the pediment include other groups of centaurs attacking women and children as well as Lapith men struggling to free them. In the corners are prone women, apparently watching the fray. Figure A in the left-hand corner is usually thought to be a slightly later replacement of a figure probably damaged in an earthquake. Several centuries later Figures B and U were apparently added to fill the space between the corner and subsequent figures.</P><P>Unlike the Race between Oenomaos and Pelops on the East Pediment which had many connections with Olympia and the recent history of the sanctuary in particular, the disruption of the wedding of Peirithoos was set in Thessaly and had no specific connection with Olympia. However, centauromachies were extremely popular in Greek art and represented the struggle of the civilized world against barbarians. In the years following the invasion of the Persians and their repulsion by the Greeks, the period in which the Temple of Zeus was built, the subject was a reference to that crisis and ultimate victory of the Greeks and to the values for which they had stood.</P>" ;

Herakles performed this task for Augeas, king of Elis, by diverting the course of the Alpheios through the stables to carry the manure away. As Brommer points out, the Labor is atypical in virtually every respect. It involves neither a monster nor any danger to Herakles. It was performed for King Augeas rather than Eurystheus and, according to Pindar, involved the exchange of money. Furthermore Herakles is left with no tangible proof that the Labor has been accomplished. The subject also differs from the other Labors in that there is no reference to it in either literature or art before its nearly contemporary appearance on the metope at Olympia and in one of Pindar's Olympian Odes (<bibl n=\"Pind. O. 10.27ff.\">Pind. O. 10.27ff.</bibl>). The local setting must account for its inclusion in both instances, and especially for its setting at the end of the metope cycle, as the findspots of the fragments indicate.</P><P> Compositionally the metope appears to have been designed for a position on the right end of the series. The design is essentially a repetition of the Cerberus Metope adjacent to it. The strong diagonal created by Herakles' pose fills the left two-thirds of the metope, though the direction of his movement is to the left, toward the center of the frieze and away from Athena rather than toward the outside. In this sense the design is less self-contained than many of the other metopes, yet it appropriately encloses the series. The figure of Athena is an echo of the young patroness of the Lion-slayer with which the series began and opposite which she stands. But she has matured, along with Herakles, and for the first time in the series wears her helmet and carries her shield and spear.</P>" ;

He has pulled the head of the animal back and, with his right knee, forces her hindquarters to the ground. The composition is one of a bold triangle occupying the height and lower width of the available space.</P><P>Other probable references to this Labor include Euripides' Herakles, Diodorus Siculus and Apollodorus (<bibl n=\"Eur.

Pictorial sources can be traced at least as for back as the archaic period, though examples are few. In the earlier representations Herakles is always shown with a multitude of horses. On the Olympia metope, the number of characters has been reduced to Herakles and a single horse. The compositional scheme is similar to that of the Cretan Bull Metope, with the hero and the animal forming an X. The design appears to have been influential, for it was repeated almost verbatum on a metope of the Hephaisteion and on another Late Classical relief from Sounion mentioned by Brommer. The image depicts only the essense of the deed, i.e. the taming of the horses. It makes no reference to Diomedes himself, to the chariot to which Herakles harnessed them to drive home or to the man-eating quality of the horses prior to their taming. A fragment of Pindar mentioned the horses of Diomedes (reference in Brommer). The earliest full reference occurs in Euripides' Alcestis of 438 BC (<bibl n=\"Eur. Alc. 479ff.\">Eur. Alc. 479ff.</bibl>); it is mentioned again in his Herakles (<bibl n=\"Eur. Her. 380ff.\">Eur. Her. 380ff.</bibl>).</P>" ;

As the earliest of the twelve canonic Labors, it is an appropriate beginning for the cycle which is first established here. Herakles and Athena appear in their most youthful guise.

The weariness of Herakles is indicative of his human frailty.

    aa:date_description "The frieze, like the metopes and the pediments, is dated within the 15-year span 447-432 B.C. covered by the Parthenon accounts. Stylistically at least some of the metopes appear to precede the frieze. The frieze, in turn, logically precedes the pediment, since it must be installed long before the pedimental figures can be hoisted into place. Because some of the same sculptors apparently worked on the metopes and frieze, and perhaps the pediments as well, it is generally assumed that the metopes were begun first, followed by the frieze and lastly the pediments. The only intervening date of importance is 438 B.C., when the cult statue was dedicated, implying, as the argument goes, that the roof must have been completed and the frieze course thus in place. This date is relevant to the frieze sculpture for those who believe the slabs were carved in workshops on the ground, in which case the dedication provides a terminus ante for the completion of the carving. Other scholars, beginning with Dinsmoor, believe the frieze blocks were hoisted into place in a rough state, and the sculpting was done in situ. One piece of evidence for this theory is the narrow band which runs along the base of the slabs. It was apparently pre-cut, and its function was to provide a setting line for the as-yet-unfinished slabs. In some cases a similar band runs across the top. The way in which the composition cuts across slabs with little regard for their edges, especially on the north and south sides, is also cited as evidence for this view. According to this school of thought the bulk of the carving was done in the 430s rather than the 440s. Scholars who believe the frieze is stylistically closer to the pediments than to the metopes find confirmation here. Within the frieze some scholars believe the south was finished last and possibly in a hurried fashion, thus accounting for the looser style of carving. Nonetheless, given the immense length of the frieze and the number of sculptors who must have worked on it, the style is remarkably uniform." ;

    aa:subject_description "<P>The traditional interpretation of the Parthenon frieze is that it depicts, in some sense, a Panathenaic procession, part of the festival of the same name celebrated each year on the occasion of Athena's birthday. Beginning with the institution of Panhellenic games in 566/65 B.C., a more elaborate festival was held every fourth year known as the Greater Panathenaia. Eventually certain rituals such as the presentation of the peplos were reserved for the Greater Panathenaia (see Shear), leading most scholars to assume the procession depicted on the frieze is associated with this festival. The frieze forms a single, continuous band around the exterior of the inner building (i.e., along the top of the wall on the north and south and over the columns of the porch on the east and west). Compositionally its plan is somewhat more complex. It begins at the southwest corner of the building. Strictly speaking the west end is the \"back\" of the temple, but in fact is the side first approached by any visitor to the Acropolis. The procession then proceeds in two directions. On the west side a figure heads up a cavalcade of horses and riders, many not yet mounted, who move across the west end of the building, around the northwest corner and on up the long north side. On the south side a similar cavalcade parallels the one on the north. The design thus envisages a procession which has split and moves around both sides of the building, converging toward the east end where it will rejoin for the enactment of the culminating ritual.</P><P>A large proportion of the frieze, i.e. all of the west and most of the north and south sides, is devoted to the cavalcade. The beginning sections depict individual horses, horsemen and marshals. On the north and south sides the riders are separated into ranks. On the south there are ten such groups; on the north side the number is greater, possibly twelve. The precise number is impossible to confirm beyond doubt owing to the extensive damage, but the number may well be significant (it has been suggested that the ten groups on the south are a reference to the ten Attic tribes). In front of the ranks of riders are chariot groups, again ten on the south and eleven or twelve on the north. Many take part in the apobates' contest in which a warrior jumps off and eventually back onto a moving chariot, a technique of ancient warfare long since abandoned on the actual battlefield but retained as a military exercise performed at the festival. Farther along both sides the focus changes to groups of men carrying objects: on the north, olive branches (somewhat hypothetical, since the painted objects are no longer extant), musical instruments (4 of each kind), hydriai (water jars) (4) and trays (3 visible). Still ahead are attendants with the sacrificial animals, on the north both horned sheep (4) and cows (4). The south side shows a similar arrangement but with some difference in the objects and numbers of figures: tablets instead of instruments (although Boardman suggests lyres) and only cows (10) as sacrificial victims.</P><P>The east side is treated somewhat differently, as it represents both a continuation of the procession and its culmination. Women head up both streams of the parade: a group of sixteen from the south and thirteen from the north. Several men accompany them. The women are sometimes identified as attendants for the sacrifice, sometimes as the Ergastinai who wove the peplos. Next to these but clearly separated from them compositionally are ten mature men, apparently one category of figures though separated by the gods and peplos scene into two sub-groups of six (to the south) and four (to the north). These figures are most frequently identified as the eponymous heroes of the ten Attic tribes. A recent suggestion is that they represent the athlothetai. The sub-group of four may be a reference to the original number of tribes. Next in order to the center is a group of seated figures, again divided by the peplos scene but united by their unquestionably larger scale. Clearly they represent the gods. They communicate neither with the heroes nor with the mortals involved in the ritual scene. They are apparently there as witnesses though invisible to the other participants and should be understood as occupying a different plane. The rocks under their feet have been thought to refer to Olympos. Finally, positioned over the center of the front porch of the cella, is the small group whose activity is the focus of the frieze. It includes an older man, usually identified as the archon basileus or chief magistrate of Athens, a woman thought to be a priestess of Athena or perhaps his wife, and three children. The two girls on the left may represent the Arrhephoroi, whose responsibilities include the weaving of the peplos. The sex of the child holding the folded peplos is much debated and his or her role in the ritual, clearly important, remains as generally mysterious as the scene itself. For though it certainly involves the ritual exchange of Athena's peplos, there is some question as to which peplos and which moment: the old one or the new, the presentation or the putting away?</P><P>It is often noted that the Parthenon frieze breaks ground in depicting a historical rather than a mythological event. Yet the frieze includes divinities and probably heroes, and though accounts of the procession are incomplete, it is certain that this representation does not seek to realistically depict the event. The single largest element of the procession consisted of the citizen body on foot, yet this aspect is entirely absent on the Parthenon frieze. Also missing is the ship from whose mast and yard-arm the peplos was suspended. Instead, attention is lavished on the cavalcade. In an attempt to explain this, Boardman counts 192 participating males exclusive of the charioteers and sees a heroization of the 192 killed at Marathon celebrated in the frieze. Other scholars have difficulty confirming the numbers but given the historical connection of the Older Parthenon with the Persians, it is conceivable that the sculptural program would include a reference to that event. Boardman's hypothesis seeks to explain the inconsistencies between the historical sources and the frieze while continuing to accept the basic premise that the frieze depicts the Panathenaic procession in some sense. Some scholars reject only Boardman's hypothesis, while others believe that the premise itself must be discarded.</P><P>If it is difficult to relate the frieze to a specific time frame, it may be possible to relate it to a specific place. Robertson, noting the emphasis on preparation rather than movement and siting the apobates contests near the Eleusinion, interprets those activities on the frieze as taking place within the Agora. He thus retains the basic premise of the Panathenaic Procession by including events which took place prior to the procession proper. Boardman agrees with the Agora setting and would place even the peplos scene there. Fehl sees the landscape elements as references to the Panathenaic Way, the Acropolis and Olympus.</P><P>The interpretation of the various carriers is yet another problem. The possible inappropriateness of horned sheep (if rams) as offerings to Athena, as pointed out by Simon, has led to a hypothesis of two distinct sacrifices. Perhaps the greatest difficulty of interpretation, however, involves the east frieze. Harrison and Kron have made a case for the identification of eponymous heroes, yet some still believe these figures to be magistrates or festival officials. A difference of opinion still confounds the identification of the various deities and, more importantly, their precise role in the scene. As already noted, the interpretation of the peplos scene, like many aspects of the frieze, is still open to question and highly controversial. Two recent proposals reject the premise that the frieze represents the Panathenaic procession. Connelly offers a new mythological interpretation: the sacrifice of the Erechtheids. Pollitt suggests the frieze celebrates aspects of contemporary Athenian society of special concern to Perikles, as expressed in his funeral oration.</P>" ;

One can assume they were finished before the statue of the Parthenos was dedicated in the temple in 438 B.C., since by that time the roof was presumably done and all supporting architectural members in place.

One hypothesis, no longer much in favor, holds that some of the metopes are in fact significantly earlier because they were carved for an earlier version of the Parthenon never built. Other theories hold that, as the first of the sculpture to be assigned, they were not yet subject to a stylistic norm. Along related lines, the overall design may have been so general in nature that sculptors were left to their own devices for all but the loosest compositional guidelines. Whatever the reason, the diversity is greater on the south and west, which share a division by metopal unit and concentration of equine bodies as well. The most stylistically conservative of the metopes  some strikingly reflective of sculpture from the Temple of Zeus at Olympia  occur in this group as well, although there are also stylistically more advanced sections on the south. The north and east metopes appear more closely related to each other than to the west or south. They share a more carefully planned design and a richness of style. It may be significant that they occupy the more important and visible sides. Brommer finds the hand of at least one sculptor (N.29) also present in the west frieze, evidence of an overlap of work assignments among the different sculpted elements of the building. The great depth of the carving, which results in many figures sculpted nearly in the round, is also noteworthy. The overall design is generally attributed to Pheidias on the basis of his responsibility for the temple sculpture as a whole, although the degree to which the metopes reflects his style must remain entirely hypothetical.</P>" ;

    aa:subject_description "<P>Each metope of the exterior Doric frieze of the Parthenon was carved with sculptural decoration. Each side of the building apparently had its own subject. Each subject depicted a battle. The general theme of each side is apparent, although the identification of the subject of specific metopes or groups of metopes is often debated. The general themes are identified as follows.</P><P><hi rend=\"ital\">West</hi>: Greeks versus Orientals. Usually identified as an Amazonomachy, although Brommer reserves the possibility that the Easterners may be Persians. The extensive damage makes it difficult to determine the sex of the opponents. However, the bare limbs of at least one of these figures suggest Amazon rather than Persian dress, which usually includes long sleeves and leggings. The horses are also characteristic of an Amazonomachy. The three central metopes of the west are damaged beyond recognition. Nonetheless it is clear that each metope appears as a sculptural unit with no obvious relationship to the metopes on either side, other than the regular alteration of equestrian scenes with scenes of unmounted opponents. There is no clear narrative progression.</P><P><hi rend=\"ital\">North</hi>: Greeks versus Trojans. Although the entire central section  more than half the side  is lost, related subjects at both ends framed by Helios rising and Nyx or Selene descending on her horse (a device also used in the East Pediment) suggest a single subject and a single time frame. The three westernmost metopes depict gods and goddesses, probably as \"witnesses\" of a sort as on the east frieze. Reading from left to right, the first metopes after Helios include men debarking from a ship and arming, apparently stages before the battle. Among the later, NM.24-25 show Menelaos pursuing Helen who has run to the Palladion for sanctuary. The identification is certain, for the scene was copied by a vase painter who inscribed the names of the figures. Since this scene takes place at the end of the battle, a sense of narrative progression is implied.</P><P><hi rend=\"ital\">East</hi>: Gods versus Giants. Severe damage leaves individual identification difficult, but enough remains to determine the general theme and suggest specific identities. Each metope apparently includes at least one god. Their pronounced presence on the east side, i.e. the principal facade, is clearly intentional. There is a certain link here with the east frieze and east pediment. There is also a clearly planned progression of scenes compositionally, with the movement toward the center from each side, as in the east frieze. However there is no sense that one scene precedes another in narrative fashion. Despite the poor condition the symmetry of the overall design is clearly apparent and its original impression must have been even stronger. The composition of the fourth slab from each end is much fuller, and the charioteer next to each of these moves toward the center, focusing attention on the four central slabs. Whatever the significance here, Athena is not the focus. Her identification is reasonably clear owing to the presence of Nike beside her. She is off to one side (E.4), not particularly prominent within the design.</P><P><hi rend=\"ital\">South</hi>: Centaurs versus Lapiths. By far the best preserved, even the missing slabs are known from the drawings of Carrey, who carefully recorded the entire side. All but the central nine (S.13-21) depict centaurs fighting men or, in a few cases, carrying off women. The central group, at least in part, is clearly set off from the battle. The problem, specific interpretation aside, is to what extent its subject relates to the fighting centaurs. The best known story of the Centauromachy involves the disruption of a wedding, and several interpretations offer a variation on this premise. The large number of women, their poses and attributes appear to support this. Some scholars see a specifically Attic myth represented. Robertson suggests that episodes in the life of Daedalus are depicted. Brommer believes that, whatever the subject, it relates directly to the centaurs so that the overall theme of the side is a unified one. The metopes involving centaurs appear, like those on the west side, to be individual units whose arrangement is not of great importance. The central metopes, however, suggest a definite relationship and order within the group.</P>" ;

    aa:subject_description "<P>Athena's Strife with Poseidon (West pediment): The subject and setting are given by Pausanias (<bibl n=\"Paus. 1.24.5\">Paus. 1.24.5</bibl>), who says the pediment represents the struggle between Athena and Poseidon for the land of Attica. Help in reconstructing the composition and identifying individual figures is provided by the drawings made by Carrey in 1674, when most of the sculptures were still in place. (Where already missing, the drawings indicate the voids left by their removal.)</P><P>The identity of the central figures is clear. Athena (L) moves left, Poseidon (M) right, away from the center of the pediment where some event has just occurred. Immediately on the left, Hermes (H) and Nike (G) driving her team rush to Athena. On the right, Iris (N) and Amphitrite (0) as Poseidon's charioteer and messenger rush toward him. Vases which depict the same subject and may reflect the pediment sometimes show an olive tree, sometimes a thunderbolt. An olive tree may have been added in bronze, though there is not much space in the center of the composition for an object of any size. (Marble fragments of olive sometimes attributed to the pediment are now usually thought Roman.) The tree would represent Athena's gift to Attica; Poseidon's gift was a salt spring. Simon has suggested that, rather than the moment of the contest itself, the aftermath is shown. Angered by his loss of the contest, Poseidon threatened to send a flood. Zeus intervened by throwing his thunderbolt. Simon has suggested the thunderbolt was represented in the center between Poseidon and Athena; a vase found at Pella now appears to support her conjecture.</P><P>As in the east pediment, it is the subsidiary figures to either side whose identities are much debated. The possibilities include personifications, heroes or gods. Modern scholarly opinion appears to be leaning in the direction of heroes, primarily because the subject is specifically Attic. The figures are essentially spectators or witnesses of the struggle in process. Since the prize is the land of Attica, it is appropriate that those most concerned be on hand. Furthermore, the number of children in family groups suggests the representation of linked generations.</P><P>For the left side a widely accepted interpretation sees Kekrops, a legendary king of Attica, as the older man (B) sitting on a rock beside a snake. Beside him is surely one of his daughters, probably the oldest, Aglauros (C). The other two young women (D and F) presumably represent the other two daughters, Pandrosos and Herse. The young man (E) is probably either his son Erysichthon or his adopted son Erichthonios, the foster child of Athena by Hephaistos and later king of Athens. In the corner (A and A*) are either personifications in the manner of the Olympia pediments  the river god Ilissos or Kephisos is usually suggested  or yet more ancient Attic hero kings, such as Aktaios, or Boutes and Erechtheus.</P><P>On the right hand side of the pediment three female figures are often correspondingly identified as the daughters of Erechtheus. The figure seated close to Amphitrite with billowy drapery and two children (P,Q,R) is suggested as Oreithyia, wife of Boreas and mother of twins. The other females (T,U) would be Kreousa and Prokris. The young male (S) is sometimes identified as Ion, although strong evidence is lacking. The aforementioned identifications make these figures Athenians. A recent proposal instead views the figures on the right hand side of the pediment as Eleusinians, descendants of Poseidon. Such an identification suggests the contest between Athena and Poseidon was seen as a metaphor for the struggle between Athens and Eleusis. The two subjects are known to be related on vases and in literature. According to this theory, the figures named above are identified as Metaneira, wife of the legendary king Keleos, and his children. The adopted son Triptolemos would parallel Erichthonios on the opposite half. Near the corner Eumolpos (V), son of Poseidon, priest/king of Eleusis and founder of the Eleusinian Mysteries, had previously been proposed and fits with the new theory as well. The figure next to him would be his mother Chione (W). An alternate interpretation of her is as Kallirhoe, an Athenian spring." ;

The statue is nearly complete, except for part of the left foot and the attributes, and is particularly interesting for all the details which are preserved intact. The figure faces forward, the weight on the right leg, the left leg relaxed. She wears a peplos open on the right side, with a long diagonal overfold, the tip of which reaches nearly to the knee. Over the dress is slung the aegis, shaped like a narrow band. Though it is bordered by snakes and emblazoned with a small head of Medusa, its significance in this instance is more a badge of identity than a weapon. Her left hand appears to have rested on a shield and may have held a spear as well. The right hand is extended forward. The open palm is pierced with a hole, as is the thumb, for attachment of an object. She may have held an owl. The helmet is pushed back on her head. Two owls are represented on the visor, and griffins stand on either side of the long crest. The eyes are inset.</P><P>A single copy of this statue exists: the Mattei Athena now in the Louvre (<rs type=\"sculpture\">Louvre Ma 530</rs>). The position of the right arm was altered, probably because of the difficulty of reproducing the same pose in marble without the use of a strut.

The head of the rider is among the more advanced elements of the group and helps to date it to the middle of the century. It is often compared with the head of Zeus in the Introduction Pediment from the Acropolis. The interest in the structure of the face and the elaborate detailing of the hair and beard is partially a result of the Attic sculptor's personal style and partly characteristic of the time. The torso of the rider received less attention and is much flatter in its treatment. Based on the perceived style of this work, a small group of other works have been attributed to this sculptor.

At least eight equestrian groups have been found on the Acropolis. The identification of these figures remains open to question. Because the Rampin Rider wears a wreath, he may represent a victor in one of the Games (if his wreath is of celery, as some believe, the Isthmian or Nemean Games; if of oak, as others think, its symbolism may be more general). The number of these groups may support their identification as victory monuments. Historical figures have also been proposed, e.g. the sons of Peisistratos. As Ridgway notes, however, at this period nudity may still suggest a mythic or at least heroic presence. The Dioskouroi have been suggested. Ridgway points out that in vase painting the Dioskouroi occasionally wear wreaths and are sometimes bearded.</P>" ;

He held his shield on his bent left arm, at waist level, and tilted his head slightly to his left and down, presumably looking at the enemy. He wore a chlamys over his left shoulder, and a Corinthian helmet.</P><P>The preserved base of the copy in the British Museum (<rs type=\"sculpture\">London 1538</rs>)--the ram of a ship, surrounded by waves--suggests that the warrior was shown on the prow of a ship, perhaps battling the enemy ashore. The identification of the warrior as Protesilaos, made originally by Edward Warren, follows Pausanias' quotation of the author of the Cypria (<bibl n=\"Paus. 4.2.5\">Paus. 4.2.5</bibl>) (cf. also <bibl n=\"Hom. Il 2.609-702\">Hom. Il 2.609-702</bibl>) that Protesilaos was the first man who dared leap ashore when the Greek fleet reached the Troad. He consequently died at the hands of Hector (<bibl n=\"Apollod. E. 3.30\">Apollod. E. 3.30</bibl>), in fulfilment of an oracle that fated the first to step on Trojan soil would be the first to fall. In <hi rend=\"ital\">Heroika, Protesilaos</hi>, Philostratos reports a cult statue of the heroized Protesilaos that showed him standing on a base shaped like the prow of a boat.</P><P>Others have identified this hero as Kyzikos (Curtius) or Telamon (Hafner). He has also been identified as the \"falling warrior\" attributed to Kresilas, by <bibl n=\"Pliny HN 34.74\">Pliny HN 34.74</bibl>, although Kresilas is known to have worked several decades later than the accepted date of the Protesilaos statue." ;

Meleager's uncles claimed the hide of the boar, after it was killed, although it had already been promised to the huntress Atalanta.  In the subsequent battle, Meleager killed his uncles, which caused his grieving mother to burn the torch to which Meleager's life was tied, thus hastening Meleager's own death.</P><P>Although the Fogg Meleager is not adorned with drapery, other copies depict him with a chlamys, or travelers cloak, speark, and even hunting dog, not to mention the slain boar at his feet.

    aa:other_notes "A definitive identification of the second female figure is hindered by the insufficient preservation of the accompanying inscription, to the point at which it is not clear whether it was an alliance or an honorary decree.  As Athena shakes hands with this female figure, it is most likely a treaty decree.  Lawton suggests that the scene is more appropriate to an alliance decree (there is no indication that the honorand was actually shown in the relief).  The text does, however, mention the honor that the Athenian Boule bestowed upon Dionysios, his brothers Leptines and Thearides, and brother-in-law Polyxenos.  U. Khler suggested that these honors were connected with  Dionysios' patronage of (Athenian) poets, at the beginning of brief rapprochement between Dionysios and Athens.  Dionysios was not given Athenian citizenship, nor contracted an alliance with Athens until the 360s, long after this stele was erected.  The identification of this female figure as a goddess is suggested by her scale, which is close to that of Athena; Lawton suggests that she is either Demeter holding grains or Persephone with her torch.  Particularly as this stele concerns Syracuse, however, it would not be surprising if she was a local personification.  Extrapolating from the coin evidence, which is particularly abundant with regard to the Syracusan mint, she could be identified as Syrakousa herself, Arethusa (the personification of the famous spring that served as a representative of the city on the remarkable dekadrachms), or Sikelia (the personification of the island, much of which Dionysios controlled by this time), as suggested by Khler." ;

The horsemen are thought to be shown as representatives of Thrace, a region known for horse breeding.

Lawton (127) strongly argues for her identification as Hera Akraia, the goddess with the most important cult at Korkyra (mentioned in <bibl n=\"Thuc. 1.24\">Thuc. 1.24</bibl>; <bibl n=\"Thuc. 3.75\">Thuc. 3.75</bibl>; <bibl n=\"Thuc. 79-81\">Thuc. 79-81</bibl> and <bibl n=\"Diod. 12.48\">Diod. 12.48</bibl>).  On parallel, the male figure would then be identified as Zeus (as on <rs type=\"sculpture\">Athens, NM 1481</rs>).  Such an interpretation is consistent with his regal appearance on this relief, although the lack of attributes hinders a sure identification.  It is doubtful that he represents Demos, particularly as his himation is only draped about his waist, rather than over the left shoulder or arm, as befits Demos.  In this regard, this male figure is more akin to the seated male figures on the treasury decrees (e.g. <rs type=\"sculpture\">Athens, EM 7859</rs>), who are now taken to be heroes rather than Demoi, for which reason he has been identified as Kekrops (see <hi rend=\"ital\"><bibl>LIMC</bibl></hi>).</P>" ;

Herakles (presumably shown here in his capacity as the hero of the honorand's home), shown at the same scale as Athena (although he appears shorter because he has no head attribute), standing 3/4-view to left, with weight on his left leg, and his right leg pulled back, reaches his right hand (in which he may have held a crown) up to Athena's helmet, and holds a chlamys (which slightly overlaps the left anta) in his bent left arm. <P>In the current state of preservation it seems that Herakles is crowning Athena, although if that were meant to be the case, surely Athena would have been shown turning to the right, toward Herakles, to receive the honor.  It is more likely, as all remaining figures are turned to the left, that they are all facing an honorand, to whom they give honor together, although the figures seem to be lined up one behind the other as in votive reliefs, where large groups of people are shown honoring the deity.

The document promises that the sons of Leukon, surely the two men shown seated, will be crowned with 1000-drachmai gold crowns at each Greater Panathenaia; the same award is extended to their brother Apollonios, according to a rider added at a later date, which would explain why Apollonios is not represented on the relief.  Lawton (98) and other have assumed that the standing male figure is Apollonios.  This is highly unlikely, not only because he is mentioned in a rider, and not in the original document, but the standing figure is suggested to be larger and/or more important than the seated figures (whether or not his seated height would be greater than theirs, his head is much higher than theirs), which would be inappropriate for a younger brother.  Further, while the seated brothers are strongly characterized, with beards and long hair, as foreigners (akin to the male free-standing figures from the Mausoleion at Halikarnassos, as noted by Lawton [98]), the standing figure is not shown with long hair.  It is more likely that he represents a personification (relatively speaking, he is still too small to represent a god), rather than a mortal.  His clothing, and to some degree his stance, are comparable to those of the standing male figure (Demos?) on <rs type=\"sculpture\">Athens, NM 2986</rs>). Further, he is shown resting on a staff, which is a normal attribute for Demos." ;

It is likely, however, and if so, the relief must have predated 317/6, when Demetrios of Phaleron abolished festival liturgies.  If the association is correct, then Eutaxia personifies the military/gymnasium discipline associated with the ephebes, as suggested by Palagia (<hi rend=\"ital\">ibid.</hi>), and this relief must have commemorated a festival event involving contestants.  In <hi rend=\"ital\"><bibl>LIMC</bibl></hi> 4 (1988) 120 s.v. Eutaxia no. 1, Palagia adds that Eutaxia (\"good order\") was a prominent quality of the ephebes, for which they were praised in Attic inscriptions from the 330s to Roman period. Ute Kron (<bibl>Kron 1976</bibl>, 237-38, 289) argues that the male figure is a phyle hero, because eutaxia was a phyle responsibility; whereas Lawton (146) argues for his identification as Demos, because liturgists for all of the phylai are listed.  The smaller figure presumably stands in place of all the victors being honored by Demos and Eutaxia (for another example of a single figure standing in place of many, see <bibl>Lawton 1995</bibl>, no. 97)." ;

An appropriate consort for Dionysos must then be sought, as the identity of the woman on his kline: Paidia (as propounded by Simon, Harrison, Bieber, and Robert) seems far preferable to Paralia (Svoronos 3.516-18; Furtwngler).

She wears sandals, a short-sleeved chiton, and a himation pulled up to veil her head.  While she rests her left hand at her side, her right hand (now broken off) seems to have held her veil to the side of her face, in an anakalypsis gesture.  To her left stood Asklepios (now missing, except for his right arm), probably also shown in a frontal view.  He seems to have worn a himation and leaned on a staff.  On the left of the other portion of the relief is preserved a young hierodoulos, of whom only the lower torso and legs are preserved.  He leads a (sacrificial) pig with his right hand.  The torso of the pig is hidden by the figure of a worshipper, who stands profile to the left, with his right foot advanced, and his right hand raised to the god in adoration. Another worshipper, perhaps his wife, follows him, and is shown in 3/4-view to the left.  She wears a chiton and himation, and also raises her right hand in adoration. To her left stands a small girl, shown standing to the left, who also wears a chiton and himation.  Behind them stands another family of worshippers." ;

Demeter wears a himation over a peplos; her himation is veiled over her polos, or cylindrical crown. To the left of Kore stands a male figure, possibly the dedicator, (So)sikrates, for he is shown at smaller scale than Demeter. He stands in 3/4-view to the left, with his weight on his right leg, and cradles a staff in his left arm, while he extends a phiale, or libation dish, in his lowered right hand. Cerberus, the two-headed (in this instance) hound of Hell, occupies the space between Pluto and Kore. On the far left stands a girl, probably Agathokleia, wearing a belted chiton with an overfold, holding grain. A diminutive winged female (?) figure, possibly Nike, shown in very low relief, flies above her, to the right, extending a wreath in her hand." ;

The female figure shown at much smaller scale (probably therefore Xenokrateia, the dedicator) stands with a nude toddler, both profile to the right. They face a youthful male figure who turns in 3/4-view towards them, and reaches down: Boardman suggests that he is Kephisos, the river god. At the far right, in the background, stands an Archaistic female figure wearing a polos--probably a Caryatid, or column sculpted in the shape of a woman.

In front of the man (to the left) sits a woman, with her feet resting on a foot stool, in 3/4-view to the right. She wears a sakkos on her head, and a himation draped over a belted chiton. Behind her stands a nude boy, presumably a servant, shown in frontal view, with his weight on his right leg, adjacent to a krater (?).

On the left is a low table covered with fruits and cakes, behind which Demeter and Persephone are seated (Demeter is shown in 3/4-view and Persephone is nearly frontal). Demeter holds her scepter over her right shoulder, wears a himation over a peplos, and touches her drapery on her left shoulder. Persephone wears a himation over a chiton, and holds a wreath (?) above her mother's head. To the left stands a nude serving boy, with his weight on his right leg, holding an oinochoe (jug) in his upraised right hand, above a volute krater on an elaborate stand. A funeral feast, following the typical pattern, occurs on the right. Behind a low table, also covered with fruits and cakes, reclines a bearded male god, wearing a himation around his legs. He holds a cake in his left hand and a drinking rhyton in his upraised right hand. At the left end of the bed (kline), sits a female figure in 3/4-view to the right, wearing a himation (which she holds over her shoulder with her right hand), over a belted chiton." ;

She wears a peplos, belted over a sleeved chiton (the buttons on the sleeves are perceptible), and a himation, which is veiled over her head and shoulders as well as her lower body. Her wavy hair is parted in the center. While her right arm (now missing) probably fell in her lap, her left arm rests on the back of her throne. A young girl, probably a slave, stands behind her, shown in a nearly frontal pose. She wears a long-sleeved knee-length tunic over a chiton, and a sakkos covers her hair. Only her head, and left arm, and lower hems are visible from behind the throne. As Clairmont suggests, a standing figure, probably a relative (a female, as indicated by the extant inscription), was likely represented in the now missing left portion of the relief." ;

In light of Clinton's reidentification of the youth on this relief as Ploutos, the comparison to Triptolemos is not so clear.  Although it would be difficult to identify this unbearded, youthful character as the Demos of Athens, who is normally shown as a mature, venerable man, it is yet conceivable that the Eleusinian Demos is here represented, as he might have been perceived as a younger, less mature entity than the Athenian Demos." ;

Her wavy hair is bound by a stephane projecting from the front of the crown of her head, so that the hair on the crown is not decorated. Beneath the stephane the hair is arranged in scallopped locks cascading down the back, three crinkled locks falling in front of each shoulder, beaded loops just in front of the ears, and narrow waves emanating from a center part over the crown.

Further excavation in 1901 by Furtwngler and periodically since then by members of the German Institute has continued to turn up material, especially from the earlier pediments. This is divided between Athens and the local museum in Aegina. The original 19th century reconstructions of the pediments continued to stand in Munich until WW II. Photographs and drawings of these reconstructions, incorrect in certain respects, appear frequently in all but the most recent publications. Ohly's study of the material has resulted in major new reconstructions of the pediments. The originals in the Glyptothek together with casts of all the fragments in Athens and Aegina are now grouped in Munich." ;

Strong observes that this terracotta portrait lies somewhere between the wax imagines and portraits created specifically to be viewed as objects of art (Strong 106).

While the nationality of the man is unknown, most scholars assume that he is an Italian.

This suggests that the portrait was made from a life mask.  Vermeule suggests a likely method by which the mask was made. Wet plaster would have been laid on the subject's face, while the subject was supine, in repose. A straw would have been inserted into the left nostril for breathing, as explained by Vermeule (28): \"the right nostril is pressed against the cartilage of the nose, while the left is puffed or flared out.\" The subject would then remain very still while the plaster hardened, in order for the plaster to capture every line, wrinkle, and facial flaw.  When completed, the mask would have been attached to the remaining part of the bust.  It is evident that the eyebrows were defined by hand, and the pupils incised. The other details of the portrait, including the ears and hair, would also have been molded by hand. This would serve as a plausible explanation as to why the subject's hair and back of head appears to have been given less attention than the facial features." ;

The shape of the head and fluffiness of the hair liken this figure to the prince portraits of Caracalla, whom Elagabalus claimed as his natural father.

The man turns to his right, and his eyes are cast even farther to the right. He raises his eyebrows slightly. His lips are soft and supple, and it appears as if his jaw hung loosely behind his round, chubby cheeks.  The bulb of the chin appears displaced slightly to the left of the vertical axis of his missing nose and lips. Two faint lines can be seen at the bottom of his neck and suggest the birth of a double chin.<P><P>Marcus Aurelius Antoninus (Elagablus) became emperor on 15 May in A.D. 218, at the age of thirteen or fourteen, and ruled until he was assassinated by the Praetorian Guard in A.D. 222.  As a hereditary priest in his home town of Emesa (Homs), Elagabalus took the name of his local Syrian sun god, El-Gabal. Vermeule suggests that this bust represents Elagabalus and was carved in August-September, A.D. 219, soon after the emperor arrived in Rome.

The griffins flanking the acanthus calyx that supports the bust, are symbols of apotheosis, which suggests that this is a posthumous portrait, which Vermeule suggests belonged to the reign of Gordianus III (A.D. 238-244). Although Balbinus was admired as a good administrator, even after his death, he was never deified officially, and this posthumous portrait merely hints at a potential divinity that he may have been accorded." ;

His head is slightly turned to the right, creating a deep crease of flesh in the throat. This fold in the flesh and the fullness of his face suggest a plumpness found also in the portraits of Domitian's brother, Titus, and father, Vespasian. Another Flavian characteristic noted by Vermeule is beady eyes. The curl of locks over the round forehead accompanied by the long neck, however, recall the portraits of Nero; the overhanging top lip is also a feature associated with Julio-Claudian rulers, particularly Caligula and Nero. These Julio-Claudian features are not surprising in the portraiture of the Flavian's, the dynasty that hoped to be seen as the rightful successors to the Julio-Claudian dynasty." ;

The \"cap-like\" hair, with layers of comma-shaped locks arranged over the forehead, is a notable departure from the disordered array of curls characteristic of the (earlier) Actium type.

An Eros presents a wreath to the satyr, and another presents a wine cup to the maenad. On each side of the lid is a flaming torch. On the front of the urn is a scene of the death of Pentheus, the king of Thebes who opposed the worship of Dionysos. The scene is crowded with nine human figures. At the left a nude Dionysos (Bacchus) is supported by a smaller satyr, Ampelos. Pentheus falls on one knee to the ground as he is attacked by two women, probably his own mother, Agave, and a follower. Two satyrs, an old Silenos, and a maenad fill the background, which also has a gnarled tree. There is a panther in the lower left. The lid was secured to the urn with three metal clamps that are no longer preserved." ;

Demosthenes refers only to publicly commissioned statues at Athens, yet it is possible that a statue of Miltiades may have been privately commissioned during his lifetime. Of the four portraits of Miltiades noted in ancient written sources, the posthumous ones to which Demosthenes referred are most likely that seen in the Prytaneion and/or that seen in the Theater of Dionysos. A portrait of Miltiades and one of Themistokles shown with it in the Prytaneion at Athens later had their names changed to those of a Roman and a Thracian, according to Pausanias (<bibl>Paus. 1.18.3</bibl>). Miltiades was also said to have been paired with Themistokles in the Theater of Dionysos at Athens, where the two were shown with Persian prisoners (Sch. Ael. Arist.=ex recensione G.

Written sources attest a variety of statues of Aristotle set up in antiquity.  That at least one was commissioned (by a certain Gryllion) during his life time is suggested by Aristotle's own will, which directed his executors to oversee that completion and erection of portraits (perhaps of Aristotle and his relatives) commissioned by Gryllion (Diog. Laert 5.15). While a location for Gryllion's works is not noted, Theophrastos' will ordered the replacement of a portrait of Aristotle in the sacred enclosure of the Lykeion (school) (Diog. Laert. 5.51). Alexander the Great, among Aristotle's other students, honored him with portraits. A headless herm, inscribed \"Alexander set up this portrait of the divine Aristole, the son of Nikomachos, fountain of all wisdom\" (<hi rend=\"ital\">IG</hi> 2.2.4261) was found in the Stoa of Attalos in the Agora at Athens. Pausanias describes a statue of Aristotle at Olympia, which bore no inscription, although Pausanias asserted it was set up by a student or a military man (<bibl n=\"Paus. 6.4.8\">Paus. 6.4.8</bibl>)." ;

The relief is relatively flat, with linear (tubular) drapery, but careful attention to anatomy, exemplified especially in the torso of the honorand.  <bibl>Mitropoulou 1976, 43-58</bibl> interpreted this as inferior, non-Attic workmanship, and conjectured accordingly that the female figure must have been a goddess from another city, such as Argos.  Clearly style and workmanship are not sufficient criteria on which to base such iconographic assertions.  Although they are dressed differently, however, the (veiled?) female on this relief is comparable to Boule on <rs type=\"sculpture\">Athens, EM 2811</rs> in stance and position, and most likely represents Boule herself." ;

The figures on the left are harder to identify, and Kosmopoulou (1997) has suggested that they are participants in the dithyramb, a tribal contest (<hi rend=\"ital\">IG</hi> 2.2, 3157) first instituted in Athens as a tribal event at Great Dionysia in 509/508, as the inscription seems to refer to <Foreign lang=Greek> *K*U*K*L*I*W*S *X*O*R*W*S</Foreign>a characteristic of the dithyramb.  She has further proposed that the lone figure at the left is probably the chorus leader, which is far more plausible than that the female figures, previously identified as male figures, represented choregoi.  She then identifies the female figures a Phylai, personifications of the tribes themselves.  Although this hypothesis is conjectural at best, it is tempting, as the regal female figures (shown at a slightly larger scale than the male participants), must be personifications, if not goddesses.  There are two present, rather than only one, as the base seems to celebrate two of Atarbos' victories.  Kosmopoulou accordingly suggests that the right block was dedicated first, and later joined by the left block.  This proposal explains the discrepancy between the two in relief style, inscriptions, and the placement of the figures atop (where the three [bronze] figures are all shifted somewhat to the right)." ;
