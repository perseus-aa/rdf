    aa:history "<P>The earliest building phase at the temple site is represented by the fragmentary stretches of converging walls located within the Hellenistic adyton. These remains are interpreted as the foundations of a late geometric sekos or open enclosure, whose superstructure was of mudbrick, constructed ca. 700 B.C. In the early sixth century, a naiskos was built inside this sekos. The remains of this naiskos are interpreted as later than the exterior walls of the sekos, due to the use of a different construction technique (by <bibl>Drerup 1964, 362-363</bibl> and <bibl>Tuchelt 1970, 197-203</bibl>). Drerup and Tuchelt therefore date the first naiskos to ca. 575 B.C.  In ca. 540 B.C., a larger temple, the archaic temple (Temple II) was built; its adyton walls enclosed the entire late geometric sekos. <bibl>Gruben 1963, 100-102</bibl> and <bibl>Fehr 1972, 56-59</bibl> see the construction of the naiskos as contemporary with the archaic Temple II, at ca. 540 B.C. The archaic sanctuary and its oracle was under the control of a priestly tribe, the Branchidai, until it was destroyed by the Persians. <bibl n=\"Hdt. 6.19.2-3\">Hdt. 6.19.2-3</bibl> attributes this destruction to Darius, in 494 B.C., while later writers, notably <bibl n=\"Strabo 14.1.5\">Strabo 14.1.5</bibl>, attribute this destruction to Xerxes in 479 B.C. The earlier destruction date is generally accepted. After the Persian destruction, there is evidence of renewed building activity at the temple: anta capitals decorated with volutes in relief, and other architectural elements, may belong to altars erected in the adyton. This evidence may indicate that Didyma remained an active cult center throughout the fifth century B.C., although there is no evidence of oracular responses until the oracle was revived in ca. 331 B.C.</P>" ;

    aa:plan "<P>The plan of the first built structure at Didyma, the so-called sekos (Temple I) dating to ca. 700 B.C., consisted of a simple rectangular enclosure, open to the sky; the foundations of this sekos have been found within the adyton of the Hellenistic temple. The walls of the sekos were not parallel, but converged towards the east. No columns are associated with the earliest sekos, and its eastern extension is unknown. In the sixth century B.C., a naiskos or small shrine was constructed inside the sekos, towards the west (rear) wall; whether or not this naiskos was built before the construction of the archaic temple (Temple II), or was contemporary with Temple II is disputed. The plan of the archaic temple is uncertain, and a number of reconstructions have been proposed. Within the Hellenistic adyton were found the north, south and west foundation walls of the adyton of the second temple, Temple II. This archaic adyton was larger than the entire sekos of ca. 700 B.C. One reconstruction of the archaic temple <bibl>Gruben 1963, fig. 1</bibl> proposed a dipteral temple on a two-stepped crepidoma, with 21 columns along the flanks, 9 across the rear, and 8 across the facade. The deep pronaos contained two rows of columns, with four columns in each row; a staircase led down to the long adyton, whose interior walls were articulated by eight projecting piers. Within the adyton, towards the west rear wall, stood the naiskos which Gruben reconstructs as distyle in antis. This naiskos and the archaic temple are reconstructed as being on axis with the archaic circular ash altar located to the east. Subsequent excavations, <bibl>Drerup 1964, 364-367</bibl>, have revealed that the adyton walls did not extend as far to the east as Gruben indicated, and thus the following reconstruction was proposed <bibl>Tuchelt 1970, 203-205</bibl>, <bibl>Tuchelt 1973, fig. 3</bibl>: a dipteral colonnade with 17 columns along the flanks, 9 across the rear, and 8 across the facade, surrounding a deep pronaos with two rows of four columns each, and an adyton, approached by a staircase from the pronaos. The interior walls of the adyton, being shorter than those imagined by Gruben, were thus articulated by only five projecting piers. In Tuchelt's reconstruction, the archaic temple is oriented on axis with the archaic circular altar ca. 40 m. to the east, whereas the naiskos, thought by Tuchelt to belong to Temple I, is out of alignment with Temple II and the archaic altar. A third reconstruction, <bibl>Fehr 1972, 16-29</bibl>, sees the archaic temple as containing some of the complexities apparent in the Hellenistic temple, in particular additional chambers and passages between the pronaos and the adyton. Fehr accepts the shorter crepidoma proposed by Tuchelt, but, employing a shorter interaxial intercolumniation, proposes a dipteral colonnade of 21 columns along the flanks and, as in the Hellenistic temple, 10 across both front and back. According to Fehr, the pronaos was five-aisled, with four rows of columns containing three in each row. Between the pronaos and the adyton was a complicated system of east chamber (in which stood two columns), transverse hallway with stairs leading to an upper floor, and an antechamber at the west, also containing two columns. Fehr also proposes that vaulted passages led from the pronaos to the adyton, the prototype for the Hellenistic arrangement.</P>" ;

Building inscriptions from ca. 299/98 B.C. refer to Seleucid funding of the construction of the temple, and indicate that work had begun; there are no building accounts from the period before 300 B.C.

Inscribed building accounts suggest that the temple was substantially complete by ca. 250 B.C., when oracular pronouncements were made; certainly work continued at the Didymeion over the centuries, as attested by the style of carving of various elements.

    aa:history "<P>Following the destruction of the archaic temple in 494 B.C., there are no records of oracular pronouncements for ca. 160 years, although the site may have remained an active cult center. In ca. 331 B.C. the oracle was revived and the planning of the new Hellenistic temple was begun. The design of the Hellenistic temple is attributed by Vitruvius to Paionios of Ephesos and Daphnis of Miletus (<bibl n=\"Vitr. 7. praef.16\">Vitr. 7. praef.16</bibl>). Although the start date for the construction of the temple is disputed, inscriptions dating to ca. 299/98 B.C. indicate that Seleukos I Nikator, significant benefactor of the town of Miletus, had provided much funding for the construction of the new temple by that date; revenue from the east stoa of the <rs type=\"building\">South Market at Miletus</rs>, funded by Seleukos' son Antiochos, also contributed to the construction of the temple. In the early third century B.C., the cult image of Apollo which had been removed by the Persians was returned to Didyma from Ecbatana by Seleukos I Nikator (<bibl n=\"Paus. 1.16.3\">Paus. 1.16.3</bibl>). Inscribed building accounts indicate that the elements of the temple which were completed prior to ca. 230 B.C. were the socle wall of the adyton, the naiskos, the vaulted passages to the adyton, and parts of the crepidoma. Prior to ca. 165 B.C., the pilasters in the adyton, the two staircases (known as labyrinths in the building accounts), doors and the main portal were completed. Also in the early years of the second century B.C., a stadium was erected to the south of the temple to accommodate games associated with the festival of Apollo Didymeus. That the temple itself was never completed is reported by Pausanias (<bibl n=\"Paus. 7.5.4\">Paus. 7.5.4</bibl>), and is apparent from a number of unfinished columns at the site. The Emperor Gaius Caligula intended to complete the temple (<bibl n=\"Suet. Gaius 21\">Suet. Gaius 21</bibl>). Certain elements of the temple, such as Ionic capital fragments, architrave fragments, corner capitals with busts of deities, and the frieze with Medusa heads, date to the second century A.D., and are witness to the intermittent periods of construction at the temple over the centuries. In A.D. 262/3 the temple was besieged by Goths, who failed to capture it. In the Byzantine period a basilica was constructed above the adyton. Later, the eastern part of the temple was converted into a fort. In 1493, an earthquake caused the collapse of all but three of the structure's columns.</P>" ;

    aa:other_notes "<P>The monumental Temple of Apollo at Didyma contains numerous features worthy of note, ranging from the unusually elaborate treatment of various architectural elements, to certain complications of design which are interpreted in the light of the oracular function of the temple.</P><P>The pilaster capitals of the interior walls of the adyton are varied in design, with an enclosed panel decorated with griffins, vertical palmettes, or acanthus foliage; these capitals probably date to the early second century B.C. Between the pilaster capitals ran a frieze of griffins and lyres, similarly dating to the second century B.C. The use of Corinthian engaged and free-standing columns in the adyton east wall and the east chamber is an example of the use of the Corinthian order to provide interior accents, and underscored the organic nature of much of the decoration of the temple. The bases of the two rows of ten columns across the east facade are treated in diverse ways, including dodecagonal bases with panels depicting Nereids and sea creatures or foliage; circular discs with meanders, laurel leaves, etc. These bases probably date to the second century A.D. The ceilings of the two staircases preserved in the east chamber are carved with a meander pattern, on which traces of red and blue paint can still be discerned. These meanders may have some connection with the function of the stairs, which are referred to as labyrinths in the building accounts. In spite of these complexities of design, the temple of Apollo at Didyma employed a system of proportions based on the standard interaxial spacing; measurements of the elevation were related to this interaxial proportion. Such a design principle may reflect the influence of such regular, ordered plans as that of the <rs type=\"building\">Temple of Athena at Priene</rs>.The high threshold of the opening in the pronaos is interpreted as a sort of stage from which the prophetess may have given oracular pronouncements. The low level of the interior of the adyton relative to the stylobate may have been dictated by the presence of the sacred spring in the adyton, an essential feature of the oracular cult. It is known that laurel groves grew in the open-air adyton, although eventually this area was also paved. An additional structure referred to in building accounts and no doubt connected with the oracle is the Chesmographion, also known as the Prophet's House. Although the exact location of this structure is not known, it stood within the temenos, and, as its name implies, may have been the site where oracular responses were written down. In seeking to explain the complexities of the design of the temple, scholars have seen the influence of Iranian palace architecture (<bibl>Fehr 1972, 14-59</bibl>) or Ptolemaic temples and residences (<bibl>Parke 1986, 128, 131 n.31</bibl>).</P>" ;

    aa:plan "<P>In plan, the temple presents a number of unusual features. It is a monumental, dipteral temple on a seven-stepped crepidoma, with decastyle facade and twenty-one columns along the flanks. The temple is oriented to the east; its pronaos is approached by a flight of fourteen steps between projecting low walls or wings. The temple has no opisthodomos; and its pronaos contains three rows of four columns each. A wall bars access to the cella (or adyton) from the pronaos; above the wall, a wide opening or window allowed the visitor to glimpse the naiskos in the interior of the cella. On the right and left sides of the west wall of the pronaos, doorways lead to two sloping, barrel-vaulted passageways. These passages or tunnels emerge on the third step of a monumental staircase. By descending this staircase, the visitor arrives in the cella; by ascending these twenty two steps, the visitor is brought back up to a room, the east chamber, situated between the pronaos and the cella. The east chamber was entered through three doors in its west wall, and contains two Corinthian columns which supported the roof of the chamber. Two staircases, at the north and south of the east chamber, perhaps led to the roof of this room. The cella or adyton was situated ca. 4 m. below the level of the east chamber, and was hypaethral. The cella walls were articulated by Ionic pilasters supported by a podium; there were nine along each side and three across the rear wall, in addition to the corner pilasters. Between the doors to the east chamber, on the east wall of the adyton, were two engaged Corinthian half-columns. Towards the rear (west) wall of the cella or adyton stood a small shrine or naiskos in the form of a tetrastyle prostyle temple of Ionic order, the location of the sacred spring of the oracle and possibly the home of the cult image of Apollo.</P>" ;

The earliest building traces on the site are of a Mycenaean megaron opening east. This was replaced by a Geometric building, and by Solon's time (ca. 600 B.C.) a rectangular hall, probably columned, running southwest-northeast had been built to accommodate a larger number of participants. The Anaktoron may have been separated from the rest of the building. There were other additions under Peisistratos, ca. 550-510 B.C., and Kimon, ca. 479-461 B.C. The Classical building (ca. 435 B.C.) by the architect Koroibos, was designed to hold large groups, up to 3000, to witness the ceremonial proceedings. In the 4th century B.C. a colonnaded porch was added to the southeastern side of the building and was known as the Stoa of Philon.</P>" ;

The absence of an altar, however, makes the identification of the apsidal hut as a temple uncertain. An altar located just to the south-east of the Geometric hekatompedon makes the identification of the structure as a temple almost certain. A building identified as a bronze foundry dating to the mid-eighth century B.C. was located ca. 5 m. north of the Geometric hekatompedon; votive figures may have been produced here.

    aa:history "<P>Three major construction phases of the stage building have been recognized. The date of the earliest stage building is disputed: some place it in the fifth century B.C. (<bibl>Fiechter 1937, 39</bibl>); others dispute this early date and place the earliest stage building, with wooden proscenium, in the late fourth century B.C. (<bibl>Dinsmoor 1975, 249</bibl>). The first stage building consisted of a rectangular structure with five rooms and three central doorways, facing a circular orchestra and an auditorium, probably of wooden scaffolding. The parascenia or projecting rooms were linked across the facade by a row of columns, whose stylobate is preserved. The southern wall of the western parodos is preserved from this early period. In keeping with the change in dramatic representation required by the demands of New Comedy, this first stage building was altered. First, a stone substructure elevated the old (wooden) stage building, transforming it into an episcenium. This lower structure then received additional alterations, including a new stone proscenium. The most significant alteration of the second construction phase, however, was the sinking of the level of the orchestra by ca. 3.35 m., and the removal of the orchestra ca. 8 m. to the north. A vaulted passageway was built below the second stage building to connect the new level of the orchestra with the area to the south of the old stage building. At this time, the seats of the auditorium were also constructed out of poros. Again, there is uncertainty over the date of this alteration, which is stated to have taken place either in the mid-fourth or mid-third century B.C. After the destruction of the city by the Romans in 198 B.C., the theater was again restored, although it is unclear whether the marble proscenium was built before or after this destruction. The foundations of the earliest stage building were again employed, and many reused blocks were used, for example in the thresholds between the doors of the proscenium.</P>" ;

Literary sources attribute the construction of the tomb to Mausolus' wife and sister Artemisia (<bibl n=\"Strabo 14.2.16\">Strabo 14.2.16</bibl>; <bibl n=\"Pliny, NH 36.30\">Pliny, NH 36.30</bibl>). Since, however, Artemisia ruled for only two years after Mausolus' death and was dead herself by 351/0 B.C., this does not allow enough time for such a monumental undertaking, and suggests that the Maussolleion was begun during Mausolus' lifetime. The tomb also fits comfortably into the city plan of Halikarnassos, which may have been reshaped by Mausolus in the mid-fourth century B.C. The tomb was still incomplete when Artemisia died, and it is unclear who was responsible for completing it, although it is generally accepted that Mausolus' brother Idreus and Idreus' sister/wife Ada may have continued work on the Maussolleion after Artemisia's death. Some scholars believe that the Maussolleion, like the surrounding temenos wall and its propylon, was never finished; others have suggested that Alexander the Great contributed to the construction of the monument, although this seems unlikely given the nature of the structure and Alexander's animosity towards the citizens of Halikarnassos for their failure to support him. It is generally considered that construction of the tomb came to a standstill in ca. 340 B.C. The Maussolleion remained undamaged at least until the 12th c. A.D. By the early 15th c., however, it had been substantially destroyed, perhaps by an earthquake, and the Knights of St. John removed much of the building stones to construct the Castle of St. Peter nearby. In the sixteenth century, a burial chamber was discovered by the Knights as they sought additional building material. The site was excavated in 1857 by Charles Newton, who removed much of the sculpture to the British Museum. Excavation resumed under Danish direction in 1966.</P>" ;

Close to home, the Nereid Monument at Xanthos (Lycia) and the Heroon of Perikles at Limyra (Lycia) may also have provided inspiration. The incorporation, however, of elements commonly found in Greek temple architecture, for example the Ionic pillars and relief friezes, suggests that the Greek sculptors and craftsmen who worked on the Maussolleion were trained in the area of religious architecture, and that precedents for such a monumental tomb structure were few.</P>" ;

The excavators suggest that perhaps it was also the location of gymnastic, agonistic, or musical events. The fact that the theater was built on exactly the same site in the fourth century B.C. suggests that the earlier structure may also have been used for entertainment. Furthermore, the discovery of a stele, carved with the archaic inscription <foreign lang=\"Greek\">*D*I*O*S*A*G*O*R*A</foreign> and located in a small temenos near the ekklesiasterion perhaps indicates some cultic associations with the building.</P><P>The form of the theater, with cavea, semi-circular orchestra, and free-standing stage building appears at Metapontum at a surprisingly early date.

These restorations probably date to the Augustan period. In the late empire, a mosaic floor was laid parallel to the east wall of the bouleuterion, and the courtyard was paved with marble slabs. In the center of the Doric courtyard is a monumental structure, most recently and convincingly interpreted as an altar, not a funerary monument <bibl>Tuchelt 1975, 91-140</bibl>.

The best-preserved section of the city wall of Miletus, the southern cross-wall, which protects the peninsula, was built in the Hellenistic period, in ca. 200-190 B.C. This section underwent a significant restoration, originally dated by <bibl>von Gerkan 1935, 125</bibl> to ca. 88 B.C., but perhaps occurring as early as ca. 150 B.C. <bibl>Winter 1971, 278</bibl>. At ca. 200-190 B.C., a new Sacred Gate was built to the north of the old gate; its towers constituted the first towers in the southern cross wall. In the first and second centuries A.D., the necessity for a defensive wall was less great; however, alterations to the Sacred Gate continued, some of its rooms functioning as part of the city's water supply system. In the late third century A.D., incursions of invaders into Asia Minor led to the restoration of the city wall. A section of wall dating to the time of Justinian extends along the north of the <rs type=\"building\">Miletus,South Market</rs>. In the Byzantine period, sections of the wall were rebuilt, and a castle was constructed incorporating the upper levels of the theater.</P>" ;

The excavators postulate that beyond the southern cross wall, ditches and outworks further protected the wall, which ran across relatively open and level ground. To the east and west, the fortification wall continues in a north-south direction, punctuated by square towers and sections of indented trace. The fortification wall also protected the city at the north. In places, the city wall contains chambers interpreted either as storage rooms for artillery, or as guardrooms. Staircases at intervals on the interior of the wall led to the various levels of the towers, and to the parodos. Significant city structures, notably the theater and stadium, are built into the city wall at the west. At the eastern extension of the southern cross wall, a monumental gateway, the Sacred Gate, marked the entrance and exit of the Sacred Way to Didyma. This Sacred Gate, in both its early and late phases, consisted of an arcuated passageway flanked by monumental square towers.

The earliest building in the vicinity of the North Market is a rectangular structure built of gneiss, located to the south-west of the market. This may have functioned as the prytaneion in the fourth century B.C. In the late fourth century B.C., a long stoa was built to the north, near the harbor (the so-called Stoa by the Harbor). Probably at about the same date the first of the stoas of the North Market, the north L-shaped stoa, was constructed. Behind this one-aisled L-shaped stoa to the west was a peristyle court, which may have served as the first commercial market for the city and probably constitutes the earliest market court in the ancient world. There are no traces of building activity at the North Market in the third century B.C. In the mid-second century B.C., an additional L-shaped, one-aisled stoa was built, running along the south and west of the North Market. Thus the market was now enclosed by a horseshoe-shaped complex of stoas. In the mid-first century B.C. an enclosing wall with a central columnar gateway was built along the east of the North Market; previously this area had remained open. In the second century A.D. the east side of the North Market was more completely enclosed by means of a row of rooms, most likely shops. Also dating to the Roman period is the addition of an upper story to the south L-shaped stoa.</P>" ;

The appearance of the South Market in the late Hellenistic period evolved gradually, in a similar manner to the North Market, and may not have been anticipated by fourth-century planners. Construction continued at the South Market throughout the Roman period, most notably with the erection of the monumental and elaborate Market Gate in the north-east corner.

B.C.) a smaller temple to Athena was erected on the site, oriented east-west; this was destroyed when the newer temple was built. Sometime in the fifth century B.C., the second temple to Athena was built on the site, and its orientation was altered to conform to the new city plan. In the late Hellenistic period, a peristyle house was built adjacent to the temple peribolos at the west; in the Roman period, additions to this house encroached even further on the temple area. In the Hellenistic period the construction of the West Agora of Miletus, to the north of the Temple of Athena, imposed further boundaries on the temple area. In the Imperial period, shops or small workrooms were built to the east of the temple, and directly over the eastern temple two vaulted rooms were constructed. It is unlikely that the temple was still standing in the Roman Imperial period; it has been suggested that the temple was systematically destroyed to provide construction material for the buildings of the Roman period.<bibl>Mallwitz 1975, 88</bibl>.</P>" ;

    aa:history "<P>The stage building and the cavea of the theater underwent significant transformations over time. Although the preserved remains date to the Roman period, the Hellenistic phases of construction are understood. Four phases of construction of the Hellenistic stage building have been recognized. The earliest skene, dating to ca. 300 B.C., was built along the line of the city wall. This skene may have had an upper story or episcenium, but had no central door in its lower story, only two flanking doors. There is no archaeological evidence for a proscenium for this first stage building, but the excavators propose a proscenium articulated with Doric half-columns and pilasters, via analogy with the proscenium of the <rs type=\"building\">Theater at Priene</rs>.</P><P>Shortly after the construction of the first stage building (ca. 300-250 B.C.) alterations were carried out, resulting in a much longer skene. During this period, there were four doors in the lower story and three in the upper story. The proscenium at this phase is reconstructed as being wider than the stage building, and having a facade articulated by 16 columns, although this is hypothetical.</P><P>The third phase of construction, dated by the excavators to sometime before the mid-second century B.C., resulted in significant changes to the stage building: a central door was opened in the lower story, the entire skene was widened again through the addition of wings at left and right, and the facade of the upper story was opened up with the addition of wide doors or thyromata. This change was probably prompted by the alteration in dramatic action which occurred at this time; the <rs type=\"building\">Theater at Priene</rs> also experienced similar renovations to accommodate the demands of New Comedy.  With the shift of action from the circular orchestra to the roof of the stage building, the facade of the upper story of the stage building became the backdrop for the action. Five large doorways or thyromata were opened up in this third phase; these doors were the location of stage scenery, and allowed the actors to enter and exit. Wooden stairs at left and right allowed access to this upper level. There is no direct evidence for alteration of the proscenium of the third stage - the existing proscenium may have been widened to accord with the greater dimensions of the stage building.</P><P>The final Hellenistic stage building was probably necessitated by the need to provide an adequate logeion. Again, the entire stage building was widened. Only the central doorway of the lower story was left open; the others were filled in, making the chambers of the lower story inaccessible and emphasizing their function now as only the substruction for the more important upper story. Stone steps which led up to the logeion, and which were originally thought to belong to the fourth construction phase, are now known to date to the Roman period.</P><P>The basic outline of the seats in the lower tiers of the cavea is thought to date to the Hellenistic period, although little is preserved of the Hellenistic cavea. In the Flavian period and again in the late second century A.D. the stage building was further elaborated.</P>" ;

The presence of the central colonnade in the cella has been variously explained either as a device to help support the wide roof span, or as the result of religious practices: if the temple was dedicated to two divinities (or to two aspects of the same divinity), the cult statues would have been displayed on either side of the central colonnade. The temple was originally termed the \"basilica\" by eighteenth-century visitors, who assumed the building to be civic in function; now, however, it is generally agreed to have been dedicated to Hera. Numerous terracotta votive figurines representing Hera were found in the vicinity. Dedications representing the sacred marriage of Hera to Zeus were also found, leading some scholars to propose that the temple housed both of their cult statues. The limestone altar, with lateral staircase, is preserved at the east; to the south is a bothros or sacrificial pit.</P>" ;

Double angle contraction is employed in the temple: the corner intercolumniations at the flanks and fronts are reduced, in order for the triglyphs in the frieze above to be centered over the columns. This contraction is distributed over the first two intercolumniations at the corners. Certain optical refinements are also employed: the stylobate is curved upwards slightly towards the center, to avoid an impression of sagging; the horizontal cornices are also slightly curved; and the columns incline slightly inwards.

The absence of a horizontal cornice, and the presence of carved coffers under the eaves created by the extension of the raking cornice are also eccentric. For the first time in Italy, Ionic columns are incorporated in a Doric temple. The Ionic columns stood on bases with a circular disc surmounted by a torus molding. Their capitals are of archaic design, with a convex cushion, and a large convex eye in the center of the volute. An egg-and-dart molding appears below the cushion of the capital. Additional Ionic features in the temple are the presence of Ionic moldings, including an egg-and-dart, on the exterior of the building above the frieze, and the emphasis on the east facade of the temple through the use of a wider ambulatory than on the flanks. The east facade is further emphasized through the elaboration of the pronaos with its Ionic columns. The capitals of the exterior colonnade were decorated with carved anthemion designs, possibly reflecting the influence of the <rs type=\"building\">Temple of Hera I</rs> nearby.

There is neither opisthodomos nor adyton. The cella building appears to be aligned with the second and fifth columns of the exterior colonnade at the facade. The pteron or ambulatory at the east facade of the temple is two intercolumniations deep, whereas it is only one intercolumniation deep around the other three sides. The temple employs equal interaxial spacing at the fac\\ades and flanks, and this measurement is used as a unit of measurement for the rest of the groundplan.

This pit is interpreted as a sacrificial pit through analogy with that in the Sanctuary of Demeter. Architecturally, the entire complex in no way resembles a typical Greek sanctuary.

The architectural style of the altar itself, however, is consistent with an earlier date, in the second half of the fourth century, leading some to conclude that the altar was planned at this time, but not actually executed until later.

By analogy with the Pergamon monument, the Priene altar was thus dated to some time after the mid-second century B.C. Recent analysis of Pullan's excavation notes and photographs, and the discovery of additional relief fragments, has led Carter (1983) to confirm Schrader's initial reconstruction of the monument as a low altar. The Pergamon analogy is thus erroneous, and the style of the reliefs may also suggest an earlier date, that is, in the last quarter of the third century B.C.</P>" ;

The presence of these features, the location of the building next to the bouleuterion, the proximity of the Sacred Stoa, and the presence of the dedicatory inscription contribute to the interpretation of the structure as a prytaneion; it has been argued, however, that there is no incontrovertible evidence that this structure is indeed the prytaneion of Priene: evidence for dining facilities is lacking, for example, and the plan contains many features of domestic architecture perhaps inappropriate for a civic building. If the present structure is indeed a prytaneion, and if its earliest construction date is accepted as the early second century B.C., there must have been an earlier prytaneion at Priene: inscriptions dating to the fourth century B.C. refer to a prytaneion, and it is most unlikely that the fourth century city would have lacked this important structure.<bibl>Miller 1978, 205-206, nos. 392-395</bibl>.</P>" ;

The form of the building which must have occupied this location before the construction of the Sacred Stoa is not known, although the excavators postulate that a shorter stoa, possibly equal in length to the stoa along the south of the agora, stood here, based on the following evidence: the rear (north) wall of the rooms of the Sacred Stoa is the earliest element of the structure, and may once have formed the rear wall of an older stoa without rear rooms. Furthermore, the eastern section of the flight of six steps connecting the agora to the level of the stoa is of later construction, containing reused blocks; this suggests that the original stoa which stood here was shorter than the Sacred Stoa, and that the staircase was extended when the longer Sacred Stoa was constructed. This reconstruction, postulating an earlier structure, has been rejected by one scholar, <bibl>Miller 1978, 123-124</bibl>, who argues that the Sacred Stoa itself may well date to the fourth century B.C. The new stoa of the second century B.C., in its extended form, would have concealed the facades of the Bouleuterion and Prytaneion to the east. In the Imperial period, one of the rear rooms was probably dedicated to the cult of Roma.</P>" ;

After 27 B.C., the sanctuary was rededicated to Athena Polias and Augustus, and continued as an important cult center throughout the Imperial period. The transformation of the opisthodomos into a closed space - perhaps a small treasury - may belong to this Roman phase; other scholars date the moldings of the new door of the opisthodomos to the second century B.C., that is, to a second phase of construction.

    aa:history "<P>The building history of the theater at Priene spans a number of centuries. Sometime after the refounding of the city (ca. 350 B.C.), the seats of the auditorium and the central orchestra were prepared (ca. 300 B.C.), at which time there may have been a temporary wooden stage building. In ca. 200 B.C. marble seats were added on the circumference of the orchestra; presumably the action still took place in the central orchestra at this time. In the mid-second century B.C., a change in the presentation of dramatic action, due to the influence of New Comedy, occurred: the roof of the proscenium became the \"stage\", instead of the central orchestra. Consequently, a stone proscenium was built at Priene in front of the stage building, which also was reconstructed in stone. The roof of the proscenium became the floor of the stage (the logeion), with the action taking place in front of the upper story of the stage building (the episcenium). At this period the episcenium was opened up with three large doors (thyromata) to accommodate the actors and hold stage scenery. Statue bases dating to ca. 135 B.C. in front of the proscenium provide a <hi rend=\"ital\">terminus ante quem</hi> for the construction of this feature. Marble benches were constructed higher up in the auditorium, to afford a better view of the action. To the late Hellenistic period should also be ascribed the walling-up of the intercolumniations of the proscenium; painted panels hung here. In the Roman Imperial period, in the second century A.D., the stage building was further articulated with a two-story facade with three doors and two niches.</P>" ;
    aa:location "Perseus" ;
    aa:other_notes "<P>Dating questions: an early document from the city, dated to ca. 330 B.C. refers to seating rights; some have assumed that therefore the theater must have been laid out by this time. Von Gerkan, however, prefers a date of ca. 300-250 B.C., based on his study of the stage building. Von Gerkan had argued that the proscenium was part of the original structure of the theater, but such an early appearance of this feature is not only unparalleled but also not supported by the archaeological evidence. The proscenium at Priene must represent a later addition. A nicety of design of the theater at Priene is the fact that the face of the proscenium stylobate coincides with the side of a theoretical square inscribed within the circle created by the orchestra, as prescribed by Vitruvius in his description of the Greek theater. (Vitruvius De Arch. 5.7.1).A marble rectangular altar was found in the orchestra, near its circumference; it is decorated with an Ionic entablature, and carried the inscription: <foreign lang=\"Greek\">*P*U*Q*O*T*I*M*O[*S]*A*G*W*N*O*Q[*E*T...]</foreign> The script dates the altar to the early second century B.C.</P><P>Numerous traces of polychromy indicate that the individual elements of the proscenium were painted with blue and red.</P>" ;

In the Late Geometric period, the wall was entirely rebuilt, with construction covering the period ca. 775-725 B.C. Wall 2 collapsed suddenly in ca. 700 B.C., probably the result of earthquake. Throughout the seventh century B.C., the city expanded beyond the original tell, and may have been largely unfortified. Some repairs to the destroyed Wall 2 took place in the seventh century, although it was not until the end of the seventh century that Wall 3 was completed. Wall 3 may have been built in response to the threat of attack from the Lydian King Alyattes, who built a massive siege mound at the north-west of the fortifications, and captured Smyrna in ca. 600 B.C. After the sack, the fortifications lay in ruins. Wall 4, the final series of fortifications at Smyrna, dates to the fourth century B.C.

    aa:history "<P>At the beginning of the seventh century B.C., an area at the north of the city, adjacent to the city wall, was reserved as a sanctuary to the goddess Athena. Due to the slope of the land, an artificial terrace was constructed, with a curved corner at the south-west. The excavators of the site identify the following construction phases:</P><P>Phase I dates to the late geometric period (725-700 B.C.); to this phase belong a 5.5 m. long stretch of wall, and a ca. 3 m. wide ramp which may have led to the altar of the late geometric temple.</P><P>Phase II (the \"sub-geometric podium\"): between ca. 675-640 B.C., a monumental podium was constructed. Differences in masonry technique indicate that this phase can itself be divided into two distinct sequences.</P><P>Phase III (the \"Orientalizing\" phase): the excavators date the erection of the cella building, and its colonnades at west and south, to ca. 640 B.C. At about this time, the podium was enlarged at the south and west. The foundations of a rectangular structure inside the cella building are interpreted as a cult base. At ca. 620-610 B.C., two additional terraces were built at the south of the temple, to accommodate dedications (votive columns and statuary). At this time, the ramp of the late geometric period (at the south of the temple) was altered, flanked with side walls, becoming the main entrance to the temenos. In ca. 600 B.C., the Lydian king Alyattes captured Old Smyrna, and the temple, which may have been unfinished, was destroyed. Almost immediately after this destruction phase, however, the temple was restored, and the west terrace was extended even further to the west. Numerous votive deposits from the period ca. 600 - 550 B.C. indicate that the temple remained a center of cult activity. A barricade wall across the main entrance to the temenos is associated with the Persian conquest of ca. 545 B.C. The absence of any deposits or associated finds suggests that the temple was abandoned after ca. 545 B.C.</P><P>An alternative theory (<bibl>Kuhn 1986</bibl>) argues that there is no evidence for the existence of the cella building prior to ca. 600 B.C., or its destruction during the Lydian sack; therefore, the entire peripteral temple may date to the first quarter of the sixth century B.C., after the sack of Alyattes.</P>" ;

Once interpreted as column bases (<bibl>Wesenberg 1971</bibl>), it was then argued that their upper diameter was smaller than the lower diameter of the column shafts, and therefore they must have appeared at the top of the shaft. Since, however, the lower diameter of these mushroom-form capitals is greater than the upper diameter of the column shaft fragments, it is argued that they must belong to some as-yet unidentified columns and did not form part of the architecture of the cella building itself. If they did belong to free-standing votive columns located, for example, to the south of the temple, these votive columns must then have been far taller than the columns of the temple itself. In fact, there is no evidence for free-standing votive columns beyond the evidence suggested by the discovery of the mushroom-shaped capitals (or bases). <bibl>Kuhn 1986, 39-80</bibl> finds this explanation unacceptable and restores the mushroom-shaped elements as column bases.</P><P>Perhaps equally problematic is the origin of the Aeolic capital type, with vertical volutes separated by a palmette.

Possible influence from eastern Ionic temples may be seen in the wider central intercolumniation and the lack of anta projections, typical to the Doric style. Other variations from the mainland Doric style include the lack of entasis, a reduced number of flutes on the columns (16), and a lack of correlation in the spacing of the triglyphs with the columns below.

    aa:other_notes "<P>The Villa of the Bronzes is a well-built and well-preserved house, and had been heavily burned, particularly in the northern part. A number of weapons found in the court and other rooms, including a shield, a sword, three knives, two spearheads, five arrowheads and thirteen slingbullets, attest to the heavy fighting here during the capture of the city, and led to the naming of the house.</P><P>The house is quite regular in plan. The court takes the common position in the center of the south side of the house, and the pastas opens to the court through a colonnade of two columns and two engaged pilasters. Two stone Doric capitals and a pilaster capital from this colonnade were found near the bases. To the north of the pastas are three rooms, two connected by a pillar partition and forming a suite with a light well like that in the <rs type=\"building\">House of Many Colors</rs>. A fourth room in the northeast corner of the house (d) was entered through an anteroom (f) from the pastas, and might have served as an andron. In the southeast corner of the house was a kitchen-complex with flue and bath, and in the southwest was a storeroom. The house had a double door, a narrow door on the west for people and a wider door, 1.9 m wide, on the east, whose threshold was rutted by cart wheels.</P><P>Although similar in plan to the <rs type=\"building\">House of Many Colors</rs>, the Villa of the Bronzes has no proper andron, but has more architecturally unspecialized space than does the <rs type=\"building\">House of Many Colors</rs>.</P><P>The house was well built and appointed. Its south and west walls were built of drafted ashlar masonry, rare at Olynthus, and the court paved with cement and stone slabs. Six of its eleven rooms were painted, some with molded plaster, and room b had a mosaic floor.</P><P>The court, of about average size, was drained to the street via a channel and terracotta pipe. Most of the finds here seem to be remains of the final battle for the city: a shield, sword, three knives, two spearheads, and seven slingbullets. The skeleton of a large calf or small cow was also found on the floor of the court, perhaps another casualty of war.</P><P>As at the <rs type=\"building\">House of Many Colors</rs>, the pastas was apparently an important workplace. In many respects the assemblages of the two pastades are remarkably similar. In the northeast corner of the pastas was a cult assemblage, with a fine marble louter and base, nearly complete and mended in antiquity, and a marble portable altar. Another portable altar was found about two meters in front of the door to room b. A great many vases were found along the north wall between the doors to rooms b and c, including an askos, a fish plate and two plates, six saucers, and many other fragments, \"usually broken in large pieces and lying on the floor as if they fell from a shelf or from somewhere above rather than as if this were any sort of a discard dump. Most of the pottery consists of the familiar small black glaze saucers\" (excavation fieldbook). This chest or shelf also held a hollow bronze instrument with claw-like projections and a few other bronze objects, while other miscellaneous metal objects were scattered through the pastas, most notably a bronze basin near the westernmost base of the pastas, a finger ring, and a heavy hook.</P><P>The two rooms north of the pastas (a and b) form a suite with light well similar to that in the <rs type=\"building\">House of Many Colors</rs>. Architecturally, the suite differs from that in the House of Many Colors, in that the light well was not accessible from the pastas but only through the pillar partition from b, and the main room b was well decorated, with red stuccoed walls and a pebble mosaic floor; but in general the two suites must have been fairly similar (especially if the main room in the House of Many Colors had been painted and paved with mosaic as was intended).</P><P>This suite was used quite differently, however, from that in the <rs type=\"building\">House of Many Colors</rs>. In the main room, a chest or other furnishing stood at the north wall, attested by eight iron bosses in two sizes. The furnishing probably held either perishable or precious objects. Two elegant lamps, one with two, the other with four nozzles and with central handles, were found nearby. Otherwise, the room contained a rather mixed assemblage: a couple of saucers, an arrowhead, two heavy hooks (perhaps attached to the door, where they were found), a pin, and three coins. We should perhaps interpret this as a more formal living or reception room, lit with fancy lamps and with decorated furniture.</P><P>The light well (a), on the other hand, had an earth floor on which were found many ashes and traces of burning, apparently not only from the fire of the destruction but from \"continuous fires here\" during the use of the house. These fires might have heated the main room of the suite. There is no reason to think that this was a cooking area: no cookingwares or bones were found here or nearby.</P><P>In the northwest corner of room a was an odd egg-shaped pithos sunk into the floor, and in the center of the west wall of the room were 20 nails, apparently the remains of another piece of furniture. Several small iron bosses were found in this room although their exact locations were not noted; they too might belong to this furnishing. Near the furnishing were two more fancy double-nozzled lamps like those in the main room, personal articles like a bone spatula, a finger ring with a decorated bezel, and two black-glazed plates. On the other side of the room near the pillar partition were at least 25 saucers and another plate, while many other vases were scattered in this room, and in the southwest corner was a large shallow pot. The interpretation of this area is difficult: presumably it serviced the main room (b), but the use of the pithos, the saucers and other objects is problematic.</P><P>The kitchen complex in the southeast corner of the house consisted of a large kitchen, a \"flue\" separated by a pillar partition, and a cement-paved bath with a tub still in situ (rooms i, j and k). The flue and bath were separated by only a light partition, which left its impression on the yellow plaster of the bath. A fragment of a lower grindstone in the kitchen might suggest that this, like the kitchen in the <rs type=\"building\">House of Many Colors</rs>, was used for food preparation, although it may have been reused here for some other purpose.</P><P>The floor of the flue was covered with a layer of ash, charcoal, burned earth and fragments of animal bones, up to 3 cm. thick; this was apparently a cooking room like the flue in the <rs type=\"building\">House of Many Colors</rs>. A tub was found in situ in the bathroom. Nearby was a large terracotta spouted basin full of ashes, perhaps a makeshift brazier for heating water.</P><P>The other corner of the house was taken up by a large storeroom (g), like that in the <rs type=\"building\">House of Many Colors</rs>. This contained a huge pithos, 1.7 m in diameter, whose lid was found nearby.</P><P>As at the <rs type=\"building\">House of Many Colors</rs>, there is architectural evidence for a second story at the Villa of the Bronzes. A stone stairbase was found along the south wall of the court, shifted out of place but probably at approximately its original location; and the kitchen has a pillar partition which probably implies a room above.</P>" ;

    aa:other_notes "<P>The \"House of Many Colors,\" (F -ii 9), in the Villa Section of Olynthus and so one of the later houses at the site, was built partly on a terrace cut into the slope of the hill, so that west of the house the bedrock rises almost to the surface. As a result, the west part of the house was quite deeply buried, under more than a meter of fill; the eastern part, however, was buried very shallowly, so that the andron in the northeast corner and the storeroom in the southeast are partly eroded away. Numerous traces of fire, blackening the stucco of the walls, reddening the mudbricks and leaving layers of ash in many of the rooms, attest the violent destruction of the house.</P><P>On the south of the rather small court was a deep portico or exedra (l), separated from the court by a colonnade. At its west end was a built altar, covered by a canopy supported by two bases. The court was thus one site of household cult, as implied by literary sources.</P><P>The pastas (e) was of the \"semi-enclosed\" type, separated from the court by a low wall which probably supported a colonnade above, and entered through a door at the northwest corner of the court. It was thus more sheltered from the elements than was the more common, open type of pastas. To judge from the quantity and types of artifacts found there, the pastas was one main locus of domestic activity. A marble louter (shallow basin on stand) was found in situ in the southwest corner, together with a storage amphora; these were probably used for washing, the amphora holding wash water. Nearby were two portable altars attesting household ritual. The louter may thus have been used for ritual cleansing (in addition perhaps to ordinary household washing). A somewhat similar situation was found in the pastas of the <rs type=\"building\">Villa of the Bronzes</rs>. Four more amphoras in the east end of the pastas stored some other substance, perhaps wine or oil. A number of vases were also found in the pastas: a fishplate, three black-glaze plates, a shallow bowl, a red-figure pelike, a miniature krater, and a lekythos. a red figured krater, a lid, and a skyphos were found in the west part of the room.</P><P>Three rooms (a, b and c) open onto the pastas. Rooms a and b were separated by a pillar-partition. This and similar spaces at Olynthus may have been light wells, the smaller room (b) being the light well, open to the sky and illuminating the larger room. The pillars would have supported a second story room above room a. The open \"skylight\" could have been fitted with a cover (<foreign lang=\"Greek\">thli/a</foreign>) to keep out the rain in bad weather, or perhaps was lit with special \"chimney tiles\" with elliptical openings (<foreign lang=\"Greek\">o)pai=a</foreign>), examples of which were found in the house. Other possible light-wells at Olynthus were found in the <rs type=\"building\">Villa of the Bronzes</rs> and house <rs type=\"building\">A iv 9</rs>.</P><P>Both these rooms were apparently still under construction when the house was burned. The main room contained an amphora full of sand for making cement, red and blue pigment stored in a small vase and piled on the floor, probably for painting walls, two small pigment grinders, and a pile of blue stone pebbles, probably intended for a mosaic floor; while the light well contained another storage amphora, this one full of cement, and a pile of cement lying on the floor nearby, a terracotta \"pithos lid or table top\" and a terracotta tray partly under the cement pile, which might have been used for mixing cement, and a pile of black pebbles. But although this suite was apparently being refurbished, it also constituted another important workplace in the House of Many Colors. The larger room contained 35 loomweights, about the right number for a loom, an epinetron and a spindle whorl, while nine more loomweights were found in the light well. Well-lit and airy yet sheltered, the larger room would have been a comfortable and convenient room for weaving. This room also contained many table vases: two fishplates (one red-figured), two plates, two hydrias and a pelike, a lekanis and three lekanis lids (two red-figured), two lekythoi, a guttus, a group of twelve miniature cups, six saucers, a skyphos (?), and two lids. The assemblage apparently contained no coarse or cookingwares. The scarcity of cups here and elsewhere in the house is surprising, and might suggest that drinking vessels of bronze or more precious metals were used in place of pottery, but were looted when the house was destroyed. The room also contained a complete terracotta female head and a female mask.</P><P>Room c, on the other hand, was more finely decorated, with cement floor and painted walls, but contained only a few, miscellaneous objects: hardware, bronze fragments and the rim of a pithos. Like so many \"North Rooms,\" the function of this space remains uncertain: its fancy decoration might suggest a room for socializing, akin to the andron.</P><P>In the northeast corner of the house was the andron (d), of the usual seven-couch size. This was entered from a relatively large anteroom (f). Both these rooms were shallowly buried, and perhaps partly for this reason few finds are preserved here; but in most other houses, androns contained relatively few artifacts. The andron itself contained only two iron spearheads. At the south end of the anteroom was found a cluster of 16 bronze decorative bosses with carbonized wood adhering to some of them, perhaps the remains of a chest or cabinet used to store equipment for the symposium, for in this area was also found a fishplate, two plates, and fragments of a krater.</P><P>The southwest corner of the house was taken up by the kitchen complex, which was entered from the courtyard. The kitchen (k) had a built hearth about in its center, although slightly skew to the walls of the room. The hearth was filled with ashes, but contained no other finds, such as bones or pottery. Three storage amphoras were found in the room, useful for storing water and other materials for cooking, but the room contained few other artifacts, only a lead disk with lotus and palmette decoration, a loomweight, a saucer, a coin and an arrowhead.</P><P>Adjoining the kitchen was a small room (g), which corresponds to the bathroom in other kitchen complexes. However, while in other houses these rooms usually contained bathtubs or holes where tubs had been robbed out, there was no sign of a bathtub here. This room contained an intact upper and lower grindstone and a few vases.</P><P>The \"flue\" (h) was separated from the kitchen by a pillar-partition; this was probably not an entrance, however, but instead access was gained through a door from the courtyard. The \"flue\" was of an unusual design: instead of the usual slab or plain earth floor, it had a trench cut into the bedrock running down the center of the room. The trench was filled with a deep layer of ash containing many bones of cows, sheep, goats, pigs and deer. Robinson suggests that the trench formed a kind of broiling pit, which was filled with coals to cook meat on spits. The flue also contained many artifacts, some of which are easily understood as cooking equipment, such as a spit support, but also including a great many other table vases, hardware, terracottas and other miscellaneous finds which are not so easily explained.</P><P>The exedra (l) south of the court was divided from the courtyard by a colonnade, and is unique at Olynthus. Its cement and pebble floor was almost bare of artifacts; a pit at its southern end may have been an unfinished cistern.</P><P>In the southeast corner of the house was a room (m) whose floor was about 0.9 m below that of the court and exedra. At least four pithoi in this room attest its use as a storeroom or <foreign lang=\"Greek\">piqew/n</foreign>. The contents of the pithoi were not preserved, but they most likely held agricultural products. This partly subterranean, cool room would, as Xenophon points out, be suitable for storage of grain and wine (<bibl n=\"Xen. Oec. 9.2-11\">Xen. Oec. 9.2-11</bibl>).</P><P>The house almost certainly had two stories. A rubble foundation spans the space between the east wall of the exedra and the easternmost colonnade base, and probably either served as or supported a stairbase. Another base at the south wall of the exedra probably supported a landing. The presence of rooms with pillar-partitions also usually implies a second story, the pillars supporting the wall of the upstairs room. Finally, over the cement and pebble floor of the exedra were found fragments of another mosaic floor, one piece about 1.3 m in length, which seem to have fallen from this second story.</P><P>The House of Many Colors is a fine example of a \"regular\" Olynthian house with a full spectrum of specialized domestic rooms. The main areas of work tend to be the best-lit: the pastas and room a, lit by the light well. The court contained few artifacts and was rather small, which stands in contrast to some other houses; but this house has an unusually large amount of well-lit but sheltered space around the court, and those spaces may have taken over some of the activities which were done in the courts in other houses.</P><P>The range of activities which can be documented in the house is perfectly compatible with what literary sources would lead us to expect in a purely domestic home: grinding grain, cooking, eating, weaving, religious cult, storage (presumably of foodstuffs), entertainment and socializing, sleeping. These activities seem to be fairly strictly spatially organized, although rooms shared more than one function: washing, domestic storage and cult in the pastas; weaving and more domestic storage in the North Room a; cooking and food preparation in the \"flue\" and kitchen; large-scale storage, probably of agricultural products, in the storeroom or <foreign lang=\"Greek\">piqew/n</foreign>.</P><P>The house had no workrooms or <hi rend=\"ital\">ergasteria</hi> not involved with normal household production like weaving and food preparation: no shops and no special installations such as are relatively common on the North Hill. While the owner might have had such workshops outside his house, it is most likely that his main source of income was agriculture, the primary and favored occupation of most Greek citizens.</P><P>This house is somewhat unusual in having the entrance to the andron rather separate from the rest of the house: the public, men's dining room seems to have been entered from the entrance hall (j), leaving the rest of the house more private and enclosed. But this probably does not constitute a formal distinction between the women's and men's quarters, the <foreign lang=\"Greek\">a)ndrwni=tis</foreign> and the <foreign lang=\"Greek\">gunaikwni=tis</foreign>, at least in the sense used by Xenophon and others (<bibl n=\"Xen. Oec. 9.2-11\">Xen. Oec. 9.2-11</bibl>). Much of the ground floor of the house seems to have been used for women's work, including the suite with light well and the kitchen complex; and these areas are not closed off from the rest of the house. While outsiders coming to symposia here did not need to pass through the rest of the house to reach the andron, the house itself is not strictly divided.</P>" ;

    aa:other_notes "<P>The House of Zoilos (D v 6) is a house of somewhat irregular plan, with a small court (j), a pastas and portico (g-h), and other rooms ranged around these spaces. The house has some seventeen rooms, an unusually large number. The southwestern part of the house-plot is taken up by two separate complexes which are not connected to the main domestic area: rooms e, i, l and m form one complex, while room n, divided into two subspaces by a spur wall, forms a second. These seem to form shops, but there are obvious differences in plan between this house and houses like <rs type=\"building\">A iv 9</rs> or <rs type=\"building\">A v 10</rs>, which allocate a large amount of space to shops but are otherwise regular in plan. In its organization, the house is more similar to the irregular houses <rs type=\"building\">A 11</rs> - A 13 and other such irregularly planned houses.</P><P>The main part of the house was entered from room p, which led immediately into the court. Room g probably formed a portico on the west side of the court, and room h the pastas on its north, although no bases were preserved. These spaces led to a series of rooms along the north side of the house (a-d), and to rooms f and k. Room b could only be entered by passing through room c, and room a only from b, so the organization of this area, as in house <rs type=\"building\">A 11</rs>, is more hierarchical than in more regular houses. There is no evidence of a second story. Most of the rooms had earth floors and unplastered walls. The court was cobbled, and rooms d and k had plastered walls, while room q, in the southeast corner, was painted red with a white baseboard.</P><P>Unlike the more regular houses, the court, pastas and portico (g) did not contain many objects and may not have been important areas of work. The court and portico were entirely bare. The pastas contained four loomweights and a spindle or distaff, but many rooms in this house contained a few loomweights, so these might be random scatter. A low poros stone tray or trough at about the center of the pastas might have been used for grinding or food preparation. An olpe, a saucer, and an earring were also found in the pastas.</P><P>Room c was apparently open to the pastas and court, and so would have been another well-lit work area, but this room too was almost bare, containing only a loomweight, a nail and boss and a coin.</P><P>Room b, on the other hand, contained fourteen loomweights, and was probably used for weaving. A vase containing green pigment was found near the door, and red pigment was found on the floor. Since so few of the rooms were plastered it is unlikely that the pigment was intended to paint walls, like the pigments in the <rs type=\"building\">House of Many Colors</rs>. In the northeast corner of the room was a pithos on its side.</P><P>In the northeast corner, room d may have been used to store domestic equipment for use in the pastas (h), as in house <rs type=\"building\">A iv 9</rs>. In this space were found more than 27 vases, including a cooking pot, a very large coarse basin, 2 gutti, an askos, five bowls, a hydria, a red-figured oinochoe, an olpe, and two storage amphoras. The room also contained part of a bronze unguentarium and the swinging handle from another bronze vessel. These were mostly found near the west and south walls, where they had fallen from shelves. A marble louter was also found here, as well as a terracotta louter or another basin, a slate pithos lid or table top, and various other finds.</P><P>To the west of the court, room f was apparently a storeroom for foodstuffs, containing another pithos and its terracotta lid, as well as a few vases.</P><P>The other rooms in the main part of the house, however, were quite barren. Room q, in the southeast corner of the house, was the best-decorated room in the house, with red walls and a white baseboard, and therefore perhaps served as a reception room or andron. It contained almost no finds, however.</P><P>The two groups of shops in the southwest corner of the house were probably used for food preparation. The western complex (rooms e, i, l, and m) contained three mortaria with spouts, a large pithos, three \"pithos lids or table tops\" (two terracotta and one stone disk) which could be used for processing food, and many vases, including a bowl, an oinochoe, and fragments of many other pots. A foundation just inside the door to the complex might have supported a counter. The other room (n) contained another slate \"table top,\" another mortarium, two louters (one stone, one terracotta), and at least eleven storage amphoras, as well as more vases. The quantities of coarsewares, mortaria, storage vessels and \"table tops\" in these shops are probably equipment for some kind of food processing, although there were no grindstones and no obvious cooking areas in either complex. These \"shops,\" then, might have been used for preparing food either for the main part of the house or, more likely, for sale outside the house.</P><P>An almost complete sales inscription was found broken and scattered around the door into room p, parts of it leaning against the wall east of the door where it had apparently been set up as a public record.1 The text records that Zoilos, the son of Philokrates, had bought the house from Diopeithes for 1200 dr., and that its neighbors were Diokles and the sons of Apollodoros. The house thus sold for less than a quarter the price of house <rs type=\"building\">A v 10</rs>, although the two sales took place in the same year and the houses are generally comparable.</P><P>Although irregular in plan, the House of Zoilos shows clear organization in its use of space, although this is quite different from the organization of other houses. The best-lit areas of the house adjoining the court, rooms c, g, h, k and p, contained relatively few finds and have little direct evidence of use. Instead, room b seems to have been used for weaving (although it is also possible that the loomweights were simply stored in this room and the loom would have been set up and worked in another space like the pastas). Room d probably was a pantry for storing domestic equipment handy to the pastas. There are no obvious cooking areas; this may have been done on portable braziers in the court or porticoes.</P><P>By contrast, the two \"shops,\" which do not communicate with the rest of the house, might have been small restaurants or other food-processing businesses. They may have belonged to Zoilos or been sold or let separately.</P>" ;

    aa:other_notes "<P>House A vii 4 contains a full range of rooms found in Olynthian house: a well-defined pastas and cobbled court, a kitchen with bath and flue in the northeast part of the house, an andron and anteroom in the southeast; two  rooms opening onto the pastas, and a shop in the southwest part of the house.</P><P>The fairly large court was cobbled, and a drain led from near the center of the court south into the street. The court contained a variety of finds and, unlike the courts of the House of Many Colors and the Villa of the Bronzes, seems to have been heavily used. Sixteen loomweights were found apparently scattered on the floor; these might be the remains of a loom, or perhaps were lost from a loom previously set up in the court. The court also contained a fair amount of domestic equipment: vases including bowls, a coarse spouted bowl or mortarium, a guttus, a lamp stand, three lekythoi and fragments of many other vessels; a bronze cup or vessel; fragments of four terracotta female masks; various pieces of hardware and other miscellaneous finds. Two bronze weights and a \"lead loomweight\" (probably another weight) from the court are probably connected with commercial activities in the house, as are other weights from this house.</P><P>Like the court, the pastas of A vii 4 was the site of a variety of activities, and their assemblages are generally similar. The pastas contained a variety of tablewares, metal vessels, and the like: a hydria, and olpe, a bowl, a guttus, two kantharoi, two lekythoi, and other vases, swinging handles from two bronze vessels, and other such finds. Most of these were found in the west part of the pastas, probably stored on shelves or in chests along the wall, as in the houses discussed above. In this area was a stone \"pithos lid or table top,\" 42 cm. in diameter; these disks could have served a variety of uses, not just as pithos lids but as portable working surfaces.</P><P>The two rooms north of the pastas (a and b) are almost identical in size, and both had plain walls and an earth floor. Room a contained only a single coin; like so many rooms at Olynthus, its function remains enigmatic, but we should always keep in mind the possibility that it contained perishable furniture. Room b, however, contained 23 loomweights, twelve of them clustered closely, the others scattered nearby. Together with the court, then, this room was seemingly used for weaving. Like the pastas and court, this room contained tablewares, including a red-figure pelike, two plates, a lekythos, a cup, a saltcellar and other fragments, and like the pastas, more jewelry, a fibula and an earring.</P><P>The \"kitchen complex\" (rooms c, d, e) shares with the other houses on this row the anomaly of lacking a pillar-partition (at least at the level preserved), despite the house's two stories. The wall between the kitchen and flue is thickened at the south, perhaps to form a kind of platform or counter.</P><P>A large stone mortar was set towards the west end of the \"kitchen\" (e), showing that this room was used for processing food. Somewhere in the room was a piece of furniture, which burned leaving a scatter of nails and ash. A few table vases and two lamps might have been stored in this although their exact situation was not noted. Like many other \"kitchens\" at Olynthus, it was relatively bare of finds.</P><P>No finds were recorded in the flue (d), but a layer of ash and traces of burning show that this was used for cooking, like flues elsewhere. The tub had been robbed out of the bathroom (c), leaving a gap in the cement pavement; two lekythoi found in the bathroom might have been for oil or perfumes used in bathing.</P><P>A small room (g) walled off at the east end of the pastas contained a pithos sunk into the floor, with a stone disk serving as a lid.</P><P>The andron is of the usual seven-couch size, entered from the court through an anteroom. As usual, these two rooms were the most highly decorated in the house. Except for the bathroom, whose walls were plastered, all the other rooms of A vii 4 had plain walls; but the andron and anteroom were painted in three colors. The andron had a white baseboard, yellow surbase and red walls, while the anteroom had a black baseboard, red surbase and yellow walls. The platform around the andron, on which the dining couches were set, was painted bright yellow.</P><P>And as so commonly at Olynthus, both rooms were all but bare. The neck of a red-figured pelike was found in the anteroom, and nothing at all in the andron. Symposium equipment such as fine cups and kraters, funnels and strainers, kottabos stands and the like were perhaps made of bronze or precious metals, and so would have been carried off by fleeing Olynthians or looted by Philip's soldiers; the absence of such assemblages here and in other houses is striking.</P><P>The large room in the southwest corner of the house had doors to both the courtyard and the street, and so probably served as a shop belonging to the owner of the house. It contained only miscellaneous finds: one coin, a lekythos, a saucer, a bronze swinging handle imbedded in the wall, three loomweights, and hardware. However, the domestic portion of the house contained a number of artifacts which seem related to retail trade: four weights and possible scales in the pastas, and two bronze weights and \"lead loomweight\" in the court.</P>" ;

    aa:other_notes "<P>This house was, in its final form, rather irregular in plan, with a very small court (i), a short \"pastas,\" a kitchen complex, and a number of rather irregular rooms which do not fit the standard Olynthian design. It seems to have been remodelled, though: in the walls between f, j, e and i were built three reused olive crushers and a reused threshold block. The house was therefore probably more regular in its original form. Unlike most of the other houses on its block, it had two stories, with a stairbase in the pastas (room e).</P><P>The small paved area (i) seems to have been the only part of the house open to the sky. In the northwest corner was a jar set into the floor for catching rainwater, like the two in house <rs type=\"building\">A iv 9</rs>; there were no other finds. The area to the south of this was not paved, and two stones along its southern side could have served as rough pillar bases supporting a roof over this area. The space would thus be open both to the court and to the alley, into which rainwater from the roof would drain. In this exedra were found 19 loomweights at floor level, suggesting that a loom had been set up here. Not far away was a bronze \"probe\" with pointed ends, perhaps actually a weaving tool.</P><P>The alley here was paved, apparently by the owners of this house since the pavement ends at the east end of the house. Unlike the alleys in some other houses, this area seems to have been kept fairly clean and not used for the disposal of refuse (probably because it was open to the exedra).</P><P>Besides the exedra, three other rooms contained large numbers of loomweights. Room h contained 22 loomweights, as well as an inscribed lead weight. Room j had 18 loomweights, and room e, the \"pastas,\" 24. Each group probably represents the debris from one loom. All these rooms adjoined the court, and could have been lit by windows; they would therefore be suitable for weaving.</P><P>Four looms is more than would be needed for household use, and with all the well-lit space adjoining the court used for weaving, amounting to about a third of the area of the house, this house seems to have been producing textiles on a relatively large scale.</P><P>Room e corresponds to the pastas of the house, although in its final form it was entered from the court through a door rather than a colonnade. As in other houses, this room was an important workspace, housing a variety of activities in this sheltered and relatively well-lit space.</P><P>In addition to weaving, the pastas was used for preparing food. A grindstone was found near the center of the room, together with a number of vases and other artifacts. In the southeast corner was a large stone mortar, buried up to its rim below the floor; and a terracotta louter base was found in the room as well. This might actually be part of a kneading trough, used to prepare dough from flour cleaned and ground with the mortar and grindstone.</P><P>The kitchen complex on the north side of the house seems regular in design: a large room (c) separated by a pillar partition from the \"flue\" (b), with a small room (a) to its north as a bath. However, like the complex in A v 10, these rooms contained only a few finds, and its use remains somewhat problematic. Few or no vases were found in the kitchen or in the flue, and no ash is recorded in the flue; there is no trace of cooking or food preparation in the complex. In the \"flue\" was an unslipped bowl on a stand, possibly a thymiaterion, a female mask and a fragment of another, and many fragments of bronze, probably from some disintegrated object. The masks and thymiaterion suggest cult more than cooking. No bathtub was found in room a, only a bone doll with attached, movable arms and a lead pendant. There is thus no sign that the kitchen was being used as such, at least at the moment the city was destroyed; the few finds might be remnants of a former use by women of the household.</P><P>The shop in the southeast corner of the house (k) had two doors to the street, but none to the rest of the house. It contained 14 coins, a lead weight, and a collection of bronze fragments including a disk with four holes pierced at its rim. The disk might have served as a small scales pan, the rest of the scales having disintegrated. The assemblage is similar to those in shops of houses <rs type=\"building\">A iv 9</rs> and <rs type=\"building\">A v 10</rs>, and quite compatible with a function of retail trade, although again it gives little indication of what was being traded.</P><P>The door to the shop in the northeast (d) was not preserved. 20 coins found here suggest that it served as a shop, but the room also housed domestic activities as well: among its contents were a lower grindstone, vases including a fishplate, a squat lekythos, a saucer, and an amphoriskos; a storage amphora, and two fibulas. This shop is perhaps another example of the rather common mixing of domestic activities with retail trade at Olynthus.</P><P>The central \"shop\" and entrance to the house, room g, contained a rather mixed group of finds: a bronze ladle with a swan's head handle, two large but disintegrated bronze objects, and an area of red pigment. This room might have been used for dyeing wool, the bronze objects perhaps basins or cauldrons for mixing hot dyes.</P><P>In A v 9, then, we see a specialization of work and use of space which we have not seen in many other Olynthian houses. All four rooms adjoining the court were devoted to weaving, three of them apparently exclusively given over to it, and another room perhaps used for dyeing wool before it was woven. The shops facing the street perhaps sold finished textiles, which have left no trace.</P><P>The household must have included a number of women, free and/or slave, to keep at least four looms busy. It is no surprise, therefore, to find an unusual amount of jewelry in this house: eleven eye beads in the \"pastas,\" an earring and bracelet in the kitchen, two fibulas in room d, an earring in g, a finger ring in l, pendants in the \"bath\" and alley, as well as another fibula and another eye bead from uncertain rooms.</P><P>As in house <rs type=\"building\">A v 10</rs>, domestic functions in this house are surprisingly restricted. The kitchen complex contained no signs of food preparation, cooking or the storage of eating or drinking equipment; instead some of these functions are documented in the pastas and room d. This may suggests a use of space rather different from that of other Olynthian houses, and more similar to that of its neighbor A v 10.</P><P>There are no provisions in A v 9 for large-scale storage of foodstuffs or other produce. One storage amphora in room d is the only large container, and the pithos in the court probably collected rainwater. In this respect the house is similar to <rs type=\"building\">A iv 9</rs>, and quite different from the houses in the Villa Section, for instance the <rs type=\"building\">House of Many Colors</rs> and the <rs type=\"building\">Villa of the Bronzes</rs>.</P>" ;

    aa:other_notes "<P>House A v 10 is rather similar in plan to house <rs type=\"building\">A iv 9</rs>. It has a well-defined pastas and courtyard, a kitchen complex, and three shops fronting onto Avenue B. It may have had a second story: a small gap in the pavement of the court against the west wall might once have held a stone base supporting a stair ascending to the south. The house was entered through double doors on Street v, like those in the Villa of the Bronzes: the entrance on the right is about 2.1 m. broad, probably for carts and wheeled traffic, and the second, narrower door on the left, only 1.2 m. broad, was probably for pedestrians. Another door led into the shop (f) on Avenue B.</P><P>The open court was fairly small, only 3.5 x 3.8 m., and was drained to the south by a drain made of stone slabs. South of the paved court was an unpaved area which must have been a covered exedra, its roof supported by a single base. The area northeast of the court was also roofed. Together, these three areas seem to have seen a wide range of activities.</P><P>The court or exedra contained a large fragment of an olive crusher or orbis. The stone was broken and there was no trace of the rest of the crushing apparatus; but while we cannot be completely certain that this stone was part of a complete machine set up here, the wide double doorway into the house, appropriate for carts and heavy loads and found in many houses where agricultural products were processed, and the findspot of the piece on the floor of the court or exedra, where such a machine would most likely have been set up, help confirm the significance of this fragment. Probably the less damaged pieces were salvaged and reused after the destruction. Two terracotta louters found here might also have been used in olive crushing.</P><P>Two groups of loomweights, one containing 23 weights, the other 38, document weaving somewhere in the house, but the room(s) in which they were found were not recorded.</P><P>Unlike some houses at Olynthus such as the <rs type=\"building\">House of Many Colors</rs> or the <rs type=\"building\">Villa of the Bronzes</rs>, the pastas of house A v 10 contained only a few objects, and may therefore not have been used for such a range of activities. Perhaps the covered exedra, being architecturally similar to the pastas, took on some of its functions.</P><P>The kitchen complex (rooms b, c and the unlabeled bathroom) is slightly irregular in design, the wall dividing the bath from the flue being skew, and the flue having a door into the kitchen rather than into the pastas or court, as is usually the case. As so often, the kitchen contained only a few, rather miscellaneous finds: a fragment of a bronze grater, a lamp, a saucer, a few pieces of hardware. A number of fragments of a bathtub were found in the bath and more in the flue.</P><P>As in house <rs type=\"building\">A iv 9</rs>, the eastern part of the house was taken up by three shops fronting on Avenue B. The central shop had doors to the street, to the domestic part of the house and to the shop to its north, while the southern shop had only a door to the street. The connection between the main house and the northern two shops shows that these at least belonged to the owner of the house. This conclusion is supported by the sales inscription.</P><P>The northern shop (d) contained a hoard of ten bronze coins and sixteen other scattered coins, not from the hoard. As in the shops of <rs type=\"building\">A iv 9</rs>, this is a large number of coins for a single room. A bronze stylus is perhaps also evidence of trade. In addition, however, the room contained a number of pieces of jewelry and vases.</P><P>The middle shop contained few finds, and was perhaps more of an entrance and anteroom than a shop per se. The southern shop, however, contained two more styli, eight coins, and a lead weight, an assemblage similar to that of the northern shop. The shop also contained a number of tablewares and coarse vases, seven loomweights, a large terracotta female head, a knife and a spearhead, and other domestic and miscellaneous objects.</P><P>A sales inscription found in room g records that Dionysius, son of Ithyras bought this house, together with the storeroom (<foreign lang=\"Greek\">o( piqew/n</foreign>) and \"all the things that bring income\" (<foreign lang=\"Greek\">t?a\\? m?i[sq]ofo/ra pa/nta</foreign>), for 5300 drachmas. The price is the highest documented value for a house at Olynthus or, for that matter, in the entire Chalcidice; other houses at Olynthus sold for between 410 and 4500 dr., and a roughly comparable house, the <rs type=\"building\">House of Zoilos</rs>, sold in the same year for less than a quarter of this price, 1200 dr. No pithoi were found in the house, and so the storeroom cannot be identified: either they were salvaged from the house after the destruction, or removed between the time the house was sold and when it was finally destroyed, or perhaps the <foreign lang=\"Greek\">piqew/n</foreign> was located outside the house. But the reason for the unusually high price is probably the inclusion of <foreign lang=\"Greek\">t?a\\? m?i[sq]ofo/ra</foreign>, which might include the three income-bringing shops on the east side of the house and the olive-crushing equipment in the court of the house. The fact that they were specifically mentioned in this sale shows that in other circumstances they might not be included with the house  shops might be rented out or sold, and other equipment sold separately  but included with the house, they probably increased its value considerably.</P><P>Domestic functions are not as well documented in this house as in some others, perhaps because it was excavated somewhat hastily. But the scarcity of equipment in the pastas and kitchen complex is probably not due simply to poor preservation or excavation; it rather suggests a different form of organization. Instead of the pastas, the court and roofed exedra took over some domestic functions. The site(s) of weaving are uncertain, but the household certainly produced its own cloth, as was normal in a Greek household.</P><P>Most interesting, however, is the variety of other sorts of work that went on in the house. An olive crusher is too great an investment for most houses to have made or needed; just like today, only a few specialists in the community actually owned such expensive machinery, and most olive growers would have rented time on the equipment when their olives were harvested (Forbes & Foxhall conservatively estimate one press per ten households in antiquity [<hi rend=\"ital\">Expedition</hi> 21 (1978) 37-47]). This house, like a number of houses in Row A and elsewhere, seems to have specialized in such agricultural processing, and been built accordingly, with wide double doors able to accommodate carts and beasts of burden. The absence of a press to extract the oil from the crushed olive pulp is not too surprising, since these could be made of wood and leave few traces.</P><P>The shops might have been part of this agricultural processing or perhaps involved with another side of the family business. The sales inscription associates <foreign lang=\"Greek\">o( piqew/n</foreign> with <foreign lang=\"Greek\">t?a\\? m?i[sq]ofo/ra pa/nta</foreign> and it is tempting to speculate that one of the shops served as a storeroom for olives or oil (its pithoi later salvaged), and so could belong with the olive-crushing enterprise. In any case, these features seem to have been considered among the most important in the house, enough to rate special mention in the sales inscription, and probably to increase the price of the house well above average.</P>" ;

    aa:other_notes "<P>A iv 9 lies in as the center of downtown Olynthus, adjoining the agora and opening onto Avenue B. It was well preserved under between 1 and 1.8 m of fill. The hill slopes off to the east here, and the the eastern part of the house lies at a lower level than the west, the house being terraced at two levels. The eastern third of the house, facing onto Avenue B, was taken up by three shops (d, f, l), of roughly equal size. The rest of the house conforms more or less to standard layout: a small court, a pastas extending the width of the domestic area of the house; one \"North Room\" (a) and an interesting suite (b-c); a kitchen complex south of the court and two rooms, g and i, in the southwest corner of the house. The construction is better than usual, with drafted ashlar masonry on the east and part of the north wall, two rooms with painted walls, and a number of stone architectural elements.</P><P>The entrance to the house leads into room c. The door was of the prothyron type, whose four bases are still preserved; but extending from the southeastern base is another series of worked stones. This is probably a stairbase, but here opening to the outside of the house, rather than to the interior. The upper floor, therefore, may have been either a separate dwelling with its own entrance from the street, or some other kind of separate space.</P><P>The pastas was originally divided from the court by a colonnade, but the intercolumniations were later partly walled off, perhaps to a height of only about a meter or so, leaving a doorway just west of the central pillar. Its walls were painted red with a white baseboard. Against the south wall of the pastas, just east of the door into room g, was found a terracotta louter base in situ, whose basin was found across the room near the door to room a. A storage amphora rested nearby against the south wall, as at the House of Many Colors, and perhaps for the same purpose, to hold water for washing. However, there were no portable altars in the pastas, and this louter was probably used for domestic washing and other tasks rather than for ritual purification. There is less evidence of furniture here than at some other houses at Olynthus, but the distribution of finds near the walls suggests that the east and west walls had shelves or other furniture: part of a red-figure pelike was found in the northeast corner, a one-handled cup in the southeast corner, while three lamps were found against the west wall. Three shallow bowls were also found in the pastas, as well as three loomweights and a spindle whorl, a swinging handle attachment from a bronze vessel, and seven coins. While the pastas does not show the quantity and variety of finds and so, presumably, of activities as some others, its uses seem in general similar, including washing and shelving of some domestic vases and equipment.</P><P>Room a, painted red with a buff baseboard, was apparently used for weaving: thirty-one loomweights, or about one loom's worth, were found in the room. The room also contained a mold for a terracotta figurine  another was found in the court, and it is possible that figurines were produced in this house.</P><P>Rooms b and c probably formed a light well like those at the House of Many Colors and the Villa of the Bronzes. There were few finds in either of these rooms.</P><P>In the southeast corner of room c was a peculiar hollow rectangle of stone and mudbrick, plastered in places, and drained by an open drain of reused rooftiles, which, at least as preserved, did not continue all the way out the door of the house. Graham suggested first that the rectangle might be the foundation of a cupboard, and later that it might have supported the stairs to the upper story; but it is far too flimsy to have supported the weight of a staircase. Within this rectangle were found the base of a marble louter, standing upright, and a portable altar. The reconstruction of the structure is problematic, but it might have formed or supported a kind of domestic shrine, the louter here used for ritual rather than general domestic washing, and the drain, which in any case could not have handled large amounts of runoff, intended for liquid offerings. The assemblage might thus be similar to those in the pastades of the House of Many Colors and the Villa of the Bronzes.</P><P>The court of this house was rather small, but well cobbled and drained by a pipe leading out the front door of the house. Pithoi were set into the floor in two corners, to catch water from the gutters. A marble louter base, inscribed <foreign lang=\"Greek\">--]*O*S  --]*H*N*H  --]*H*N*I*O*S</foreign>, was set against the north wall of the court; and nearby was a plastic vase of a Silenus. Another mold for a terracotta figurine was found in the court, the second in this house, suggesting that the owner was in some way connected with coroplasty.</P>" ;

    aa:other_notes "<P>The southern three houses in Row A, houses A 11 - A 13, are irregular in plan but rather similar to one another. Like the other houses in Row A, house A 11 is larger than the average Olynthian house, measuring 17.7 x 21.3 m, including the alley between it and A 12, and is built against the west fortification wall of the city. It is irregular in plan, consisting of a series of architecturally unspecialized rooms arranged around a courtyard (g), with no kitchen, andron, or other specialized spaces. The house has no pastas; all of its rooms seem fairly enclosed. Half of the rooms are roughly the same size: a, d, e, h, i and j are all about 4.9 x 4.5 m; the other rooms somewhat smaller. The rooms are arranged in a more hierarchical fashion than those of \"typical\" houses: for instance, the only entrance into room e is through rooms h and i, and the only entrance into room k is through l. The walls are unplastered and unpainted; the floors all earth. The entrance to the house is not certain, since its east wall was not preserved above its foundations, but was probably through the \"alley,\" room m. There is no evidence for a second floor. The house thus shows a less organized and \"typical\" architectural arrangement of space than the more regular houses at Olynthus.</P><P>To judge from the distribution of artifacts in the rooms, the use of space was less organized as well. Some activities are restricted to specific rooms, for instance weaving in room d, where 25 loomweights were found. But other types of artifacts and activities seem distributed all over the house. The rooms in the northwestern part of the house, for instance, contained storage amphoras in roughly equal numbers: five rooms (c, d, e, h, and k) each contained two amphoras, while a sixth (i) contained four. Whatever these amphoras were used to store, no single space seems to have been designated for storage, but instead that function was distributed through many rooms. Likewise, no room has a great concentration of vases: tablewares are found, in moderate numbers, in rooms e, f, g, h, k, l and m, but there is no specific room where household equipment was stored, as there was, for instance, in house <rs type=\"building\">A iv 9</rs> or the <rs type=\"building\">House of Many Colors</rs>.</P><P>Other notable artifacts in the house include a lower grindstone which was found in room h; \"pithos lids or table tops\" in e and h; a louter base in b and a louter and base in j. And in the western part of the court was found a cache of at least eight plastic vases and terracottas, including a head of Dionysus and a faun head, two male heads, a female mask, and three female figures. Such caches are not uncommon in the courts and porticoes of houses at Olynthus. Finally, this house, like its neighbors A 12 and A 13, contained a large number of coins. Room j had a hoard of 10 bronze coins, and the whole house contained some 96 coins, including six silver coins; this is second only to house <rs type=\"building\">A iv 9</rs>, which contained 100 coins.</P><P>A sales inscription (or, more precisely, an inscription recording a \"sale on condition that the seller may release the property from the buyer's claim on it,\" or a \"security in the form of a conditional sale,\" one of the many roundabout ways the Greeks negotiated loans) was found in the courtyard, recording that this house was used as security on a 2000 dr. loan to Archidamus, son of Metrichus. The inscription lists the neighbors as Polyxenus the son of Telagrus and Pythion, the son of Diodorus; Polyxenus and Pythion also served as witnesses to the transaction. It is notable that among the magistrates of the Chalcidic mint were men named Archidamus and Polyxenus. If these are the same men as those named in this inscription, it is interesting that they were neighbors, and that these prominent men would own such irregular and architecturally undistinguished houses.</P>" ;

The Parthenon was created by Iktinos, Kallikrates and Pheidias. The eastern cella was dedicated to Athena Polias (Dinsmoor says it was known as the Neos Hekatompedos, or cella of 100 feet) and the western cella was dedicated to Athena Parthenos, \"the Virgin,\" from which the whole building became known as the Parthenon. It is likely that the doors of the western cella were strengthened with bronze bars and that the western cella was used as a treasury. The eastern doors were probably hollow bronze. Lawrence differs with Stevens on the reconstruction of all the doors in that Steven's doors have rectangular grilled areas above the lintels to reduce weight and to allow light to enter the sanctuaries. The Classical Parthenon seems to have been damaged by fire but the exact date of the fire and subsequent repairs is debated, with suggestions ranging from 150 B.C. to 267 A.D. (during the invasion of the Herulians). In any case, repairs included the exact reconstruction of the colonnade of the eastern cella, a new statue base and repairs to the capitals on the columns of the western porch. The Parthenon was converted to a Christian church ca. 600 A.D., and in 1687 a small mosque was built in the cella.</P>" ;

He believed the rectangular building bedding farther up the slope of the Kolonos Agoraios was the foundation for a temple of Roman times, replacing an earlier temple which housed the cult statue of Aphrodite Ourania by Pheidias. Camp, however, makes no mention of a temple and his map of the Agora at ca. 300 B.C., (by Dinsmoor, 1983) shows a broad flight of stairs at this location. Also, a fine, large altar was excavated (1981) west of the Painted Stoa, and is referred to by Camp as the Altar of Aphrodite Ourania; he considers the accompanying temple to be located (unexcavated) to the west.</P>" ;

According to Travlos, the 5th century B.C. theater was simple and consisted of a small number of stone and wooden benches on the hillside and a small semi-circular terrace as the orchestra. Lykourgos is thought to be responsible for the 4th century B.C. form of the theater, which is the general form of the theater today (although there have been later alterations and additions).
